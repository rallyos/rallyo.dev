<p>Surprise surprise! Another week, another productivity thingy.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve probably read about brain.fm in Engadget because I remember trying it at work for a while, without being that much impressed, although every time I listen to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGNqNHqH9Nw">wonderful track</a> they&rsquo;ve put for free on YouTube, I think about checking it again.</p>

<p>These weeks I really have trouble finding what to use as a background noise while working and studying (one can listen to only that much lo-fi and boom bap mixes) so it was the perfect time to try it again.</p>

<p>I found the promo code they&rsquo;ve sent me around April and was able to subscribe at a really unemployment friendly price. Now after using it on a daily basis for more than 10 days, these are my review points:</p>

<p><strong>It does the job</strong>. Although there&rsquo;s always a chance to stumble on a track that just doesn&rsquo;t work for you (music is highly personal thing), most of them are really good for focusing on your tasks. I won&rsquo;t go into details about the science they use - it&rsquo;s one of their main selling points, so you can just <a href="https://www.brain.fm/science">read about it from the source</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Actually better for sleeping or relaxing.</strong> Using their service for focusing on work is great, but the catalogue in their sleep or relaxing section is my favourite thing so far. I was stuck on listening to a few lo-fi mixes before bed, so trying brain.fm was a welcomed change. The relaxing section has one of the best tracks you can get with you for that sweet quick nap.</p>

<p><strong>Repetitive enough to find favourites, not repetitive enough to get annoyed.</strong> One reservation you can have about such service, is that the music will start to get repetitive and annoy you. So far this haven&rsquo;t happened to me, I&rsquo;ve favourited a few tracks and listened to the same category almost every day - it&rsquo;s all good for now. I actually think that it will be harder to remember individual songs because of the vibey/vibrating (don&rsquo;t know how to call them) bits that they add to the music, it makes focusing on individual parts or sounds from the music really hard.</p>

<p>Do try their service if you, as me, are in constant struggle about what to listen, and if you do - <strong>please make sure that you try their mobile apps</strong>, they are much better than the experience you&rsquo;ll get on their web page.</p>
