<p>After I <a href="/things/dark-souls">finished Dark Souls</a>, it was only a matter of time until I played the second one. I actually didn’t play it right away because, unsurprisingly, I wanted to take a break from Dark Souls.</p>

<p>That all ended this recently, when on a bad Saturday I decided to just check it out, to get my mind off things, and oh boy didn’t it do it for me.</p>

<p>The beginning of this game is so punishing when you haven’t played Dark Souls in a while, that I started thinking that I was trash. I was stuck on some of the first couple of bosses for more time than I expected. The mechanics of 2 are a bit different from 1, so it took me some time to get used to it.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://youtu.be/Busrd7j-ueA">Ruin Sentines</a> were my first look at the soul of this game. I so hopelessly stuck on them, that I had to read the wiki, only to find out that there is a hammer in this zone that makes the fight easier.</p>

<p>Though things turned around, and after that, the bosses were actually the easiest part, while the enemies in the zones were the hardest part. This is a big difference to the first Dark Souls. The bosses in 2 were sometimes laughably easy, and the challenge usually was to get through the zone (looking at you Iron Keep).</p>

<p>Things took a dark turn in the DLCs, though. Not only the zones were hard, but the bosses were a real pain in the ass. Nevertheless, the DLCs were my most favourite part of the game. Maybe because of the challenge. The earlier game feels a bit unbalanced, while the DLCs just don’t take prisoners. I was stuck on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NygqYMJ38zM">Blue Smelter</a> demon for days. The <a href="https://youtu.be/SeZHXi0dD8k">last boss fight</a> was the cherry on the top, what an entry this boss does, one of the best.</p>

<p>Overall, it was not as bad as people say it was. Definitely suffers from some shortcomings, but I enjoyed it. One negative was that I was too stressed due to pushing myself to finish it in a week because I didn’t really have spare time. I wanted to be done with it as quick as possible, and with such challenging zones and more than 40 bosses – it wasn’t easy.</p>

<p>Don’t listen to people who say “skip it”. Try it yourself.</p>
