         <p>I am writing this many weeks later after the events transpired, so this <a href="/things">‚Äúthingy‚Äù</a> would lose its emotional parts, but this may be for good.</p>

<p>I <del>have</del> had this approach to job hunting where I would choose a company purely based on values and then try to tailor my resume and tech stack to give me a better chance, as I am fluid about the programming languages I use. Being flexible opens many doors in the tech world.</p>

<p>So, recently I didn‚Äôt receive an offer from a company for which I had a very good feeling that we‚Äôll be a good fit. I even spent a little more than a week designing my resume. Time which I now think was 100% lost, even more, I would say, than if I just purely played games for this period.</p>

<p>Yes - some companies like that candidates go for the extra mile and show that they really want the job, but this should be acknowledged with something more than the sugared-down ‚Äúwe need someone with more experience‚Äù that I got.</p>

<p>I have no issues to say that I was irritated for the next day or two, after all - I spent a few months specialising in the tech stack of this company. I could‚Äôve used the time in a better way for my career, a thing that became evident when I applied to Uber after that.</p>

<p>I am perfectly aware that you can be the greatest candidate ever(not my case üôÉ) and still not receive an offer. Interviewing can be crushing for anyone.</p>

<p>Main takeaway for me here is to not fall in this trap ever again. You can even read it other places ‚Äî don‚Äôt prioritise too much on a single company, it can backfire.</p>

<p>Anyway, this experience may lead to a more detailed ‚Äúlessons-learned‚Äù post in the future, so I‚Äôll end it here. I just wanted to write this for historical reasons.</p>
