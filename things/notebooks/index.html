         <p>I was a strong opponent to writing on paper, <a href="/things/habitica/">I&rsquo;ve tried a plethora of to-do apps</a>, used an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SiR_7u9Rps">erasable &ldquo;<del>smart</del> notebook&rdquo;</a>, <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/fiftythree-pencil">bought a touch screen pen</a>, there was even a time that I was worried that I won&rsquo;t be able to fill legal documents right (that bad) but it wasn&rsquo;t until I decided to buy myself a Fountain Pen as a gift (inspired from a subreddit about fountain pens) that I turned my mind around paper.</p>

<p>Suddenly I forced myself to write on paper just to satisfy the  purchase I made. I slowly started to integrate notebooks in my work routine, creating simple to-do lists which laid on my desk for me to obsess about, and make sure I don&rsquo;t forget something important for the day. The feeling of crossing a completed item or placing a tick next to it, is just different on paper.</p>

<p>Two years after that change, I still use paper notebooks often, mostly when I&rsquo;m studying or planning things. Recently I liked the idea of having a book-like notebooks curated by me, and have in them only things I find important about a topic. I&rsquo;ve already started with the one I use to study computer science stuff. The goal is to have something that I personally made, which I can use for reference or learning.</p>

<p>I like to obsess about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6xxImXO__I">how the notebooks I own are designed</a> and <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/PenmanshipPorn/search/?q=notebook&amp;sort=top&amp;restrict_sr=on">the personal touch I can give to them</a>. It&rsquo;s something physical that you can pull out whenever you want, the only requirement is to have it in your bag or pocket. You don&rsquo;t have to worry about battery or internet.</p>
