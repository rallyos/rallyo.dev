         <p>I’ve been having pretty much the same night routine in the last 3 months — going out to skate with my longboard while listening to a podcast or an album (Beach House, mostly).</p>

<p>Doing this at the end of the summer was actually pretty fun. The uplifting summer mood and generally the absence of bad things to obsess about were really enjoying.</p>

<p>Going into the winter, I feel a huge difference. The feeling right now, I can describe as calm but uneasy.</p>

<p>For me, it’s a mix of the cold air that hits you at the moment you go out(&lt;3), the thoughts about how much work I have left to do because I slacked in the summer, the feeling of being unsure about how your next month is going to look like, the fear of losing control over your own plans.</p>

<p>I go out skating to enjoy that one hour of clean mind and feeling of freedom that this gives you. Sadly, right now, you can’t have even this.<br />
You are constantly reminded by the passing ambulances that you are in the middle of a health crisis. They are like a window to a parallel world where medics on the front line risk their lives without much in return, and yours, where you are trying to enjoy yourself after a long day of doing things on a computer. I often feel bad for ambulance drivers when I pass them by on a crosswalk.</p>

<p>And this is not fiction or some creative writing. Every night that I’m out, I have a game where I bet against myself if I’m going to see an ambulance passing me by. And I lose it every time. Sometimes by the fifth minute.</p>
