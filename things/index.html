        <strong>“Thing of the week”</strong> is a journal like section where I write about something important from my week worthy enough to be shared.

              Not the first time I’ll praise a GTA radio, and probably not the last.
I played GTA 5 a bit this summer (just to finish the story) and maybe the most important thing to come out of that is the discovery of Radio Los Santos.

              There’s a whole corner in YouTube full of nicely done indie documentaries. One such finding is the History of the Earth channel.
I love this channel because its focus is early earth and its extinctions something that is very rare on YouTube, it is probably the only channel I know of that tells these stories in depth.

              After more than 20 years of now owning a bike, I finally felt the need to buy myself one. I use it mainly for cycling with friends, but I can attest that it’s also a good workout replacement if I skip my rowing for some reason.

              TV shows and movies can best represent the times they’ve made in, so it’s always interesting to watch episodes that satirise or give a funny twist to a real life events. For those like me which are just now watching South Park episodes that were made 10 years ago for example — it’s funny how sometimes I don’t really get the context of the story because they reference events that I haven’t followed at the time the episode was aired.

              After a year after I wrote about Internet Historian: Engoodening of No Mans Sky. I finally have some play time in it.
Initially, I was very invested in the game. I played it for non-stop for a couple of days.

              It’s here, the most awaited scientific product recently - the COVID vaccine. I got my first shot recently and I’m kind of hyped about the opportunities that it will open for me. I’ll finally feel safe to travel to Sofia to see my friends there.

              One of my favourite channels on YouTube. It’s hard to explain, so I guess a good starting point is this video although some may prefer jumping straight into some of their best work.
I would say it’s a channel documenting the American culture (mostly the bad parts, but hey…there’s people like this everywhere)

              I have listened to some synthwave videos on YouTube, but I have newfound love for them because they mix perfectly in my early morning routine. Every morning that I start wondering what I should listen to - I end up with a nice melancholic synthwave video with a cool futuristic anime scene.

              I have never had a good gaming PC. I always had a normal computer, just enough to run a relatively old game without annoying me, in most of the cases - just enough to play World of Warcraft without major issues.

              Maybe a followup to Elections.
The new parliament swore, and I’m continuing to very much enjoy our “political crisis” as some are over dramatising.
I watch the sessions live when I can, I even watch the sessions of commissions that the parliament forms for every field that requires attention from lawmakers.

              I’ve written on a couple of occasions about the current political situation in Bulgaria.

              I have a new favourite twitter profile.

              I have a soft spot for catchy basslines. That’s why I got addicted to Be Sweet by Japanese Breakfast the moment I heard it (thank you Pitchfork). It’s such a summerish song, I can’t wait to hear the whole album in June.

              For those that do it often (1-2 years), there are few things more enjoyable for a software engineer, than learning a new programming language.
I started learning Rust this week and was again reminded of the nice and warm feeling you get from playing with a new language.

              I’m a little late to the NF party, some of my friends were talking about him two years ago, but sometimes I don’t believe the hype.

              This game has a special place in my heart:
- It was my way to cope with the first 2020 lockdown. I played it 12+ hours a day for a few weeks straight. Aside from some stressful runs, it was a great distraction that kept me from reading covid news all day (I allowed myself to check news only during dinner)

              Some people hate the so-called algorithmic code challenges, probably because of their overuse in interviews, but to be fair - I love like them.
I have my portion of failed interviews because of an unsolved code challenge, so I see how one can be against them, or even feel stressed out just from opening Leetcode.

              I am writing this many weeks later after the events transpired, so this “thingy” would lose its emotional parts, but this may be for good.
I have had this approach to job hunting where I would choose a company purely based on values and then try to tailor my resume and tech stack to give me a better chance, as I am fluid about the programming languages I use.

              Nostalgia would be a prevalent topic in these journal-like series, so this great video by Vsauce is unsurprisingly the thing of the week.
It’s a 30-minute masterpiece on how people perceive time. Aside from constantly making you ask yourself “Am I really that old now” it presents research and terms to explain for example, why it seems that time goes faster as we age, and our own biases when we think about events that happened in the past.

              I love watching videos about open source engineers and their projects.
Often I will have one of these days where it’s plain hard to motivate myself to work on my projects, or some chore (especially if it’s not that interesting and it feels more like a boring chore).

              I’ve watched many of the binaural city walk around city X videos, but it wasn’t until this year’s pandemic that made me fully appreciate them.
If you are in lockdown, can’t travel, and feeling nostalgic about a place you miss — watching such videos can fill that void.

Someone at Evernote decided that people want more AI in their notes, which unsurprisingly turned out to be wrong and drove some people out of their platform.

              I’ve been having pretty much the same night routine in the last 3 months — going out to skate with my longboard while listening to a podcast or an album (Beach House, mostly).
