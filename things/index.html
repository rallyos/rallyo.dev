              This week’s thing is my helper in writing these posts. The Ulysses app.
Originally, I was an iA Writer user, but for some purposes it became a bit limited for me.
For example, I need a tool that checks my writing, and copy-pasting text to some web service is not only time-consuming, but it leads to context-switching.

              Pressing play on Mad Max: Fury Road yesterday I definitely didn’t expect such movie. I wanted to watch it because I saw it in some letterboxd lists about world building and aesthetic.
On my movie nights I usually eat in the first 30 minutes, but this time I definitely didn’t expect to not be able to, for like 30 minutes.

              This week’s thing is this video about February. I always looked at it as the most boring winter month, but this video made me even hate it a bit. It’s grey, dark, and people usually can’t wait for it to end, so we can start anticipating spring.

              I added Severance to my watch list the moment I saw the trailer. I had no doubt it will be good because the idea, at least for me, was unheard of. And in the world of reboots, prequels, and sequels, you have to respect creativity.

              This week I found about a Spotify feature that I didn’t know existed.
I was listening to a Spotify made electronic playlist and started to notice that songs just don’t end. ”Is this a one song” I wandered as the tempo changed, but barely.

              Recently, I got back from my first trip outside the country for a vacation since late 2019. I was in Lisbon with friends for a week and it was pretty cool.
The weather was 100% sunny, but a bit colder than I expected.

              I was reluctant to check Disney Plus when it became available because I thought it’s all Marvel, Star Wars, and animations, but I was wrong.
I wanted to watch a movie that was available only there, so I decided to just get the trial, so I can watch it, and maybe explore a bit how their collection is.

              I’ve seen no hit runs and other challenges that people like to torture themselves with, but for the first time I saw someone playing the game not only in two parallel versions, but also with different controllers.

              I was never a movie buff. I rarely missed a good sci-fi, but I’ve always been more of a TV shows guy. Through the years though I missed seeing some movies, and my watch list started to grow unconformably big, so I was already feeling the pressure of not having seen some pictures.

              I have a soft heart for punishing games, so it’s no surprise that RimWorld was on my wish list for quite some time. Though after the week of Factorio I did 3 years ago, I wasn’t exactly looking forward to that game, seeing how close they are in some ways.

              It’s the holidays. I usually have several Christmas lo-fi videos that I listen to for the mood, but this year I had a new idea – find retro Christmas commercials – and play them as a background to the music.

              I’ve been a VIM user for close to 6 years. I always used the regular one, though with a good number of plugins. Haven’t made a change in my setup for about in 3 years, so I guess I was ready to shake things up.

              My thing of the week this time is a new podcast from Joshua Topolsky (Engadget, The Verge, and other cool places on the internet). It’s called What Future.
I’ve been following him for many years, so I have no doubt that it will be very intriguing.

              I’ve read two Philip K. Dick books, so knowing at least partially what to expect, I was excited when I saw that someone is about to make a TV show out of his stories. Especially knowing how much he contributed to the futuristic sci-fi genre.

              It’s a tradition to mention comedy YouTube channels I follow, so here’s another one – Trey Kennedy.
He definitely has a unique niche in the comedy part of YouTube. He’s especially good when acting as a woman.

              This year, I have a new favourite dream pop band (at least that’s how I categorise them). I don’t know where I heard them, probably a Spotify radio recommendation, but I kept a song from them in my skating playlist, until discovering more of them.

              Atlas Obscura I discovered as a podcast first, of course, being featured on 99% invisible. Later I found out that the podcast is just part of their service – providing exploration of “the hidden wonders of the world”.

              One of the news outlets that I follow shared this video of a championship game between Ipswich and Charlton, that was going 2:2 in the regular time, but then it got to 4:4 in the stoppage time of 6 (8) minutes.

              A while ago, I had a Withings Steel HR, but I started to hate it because of the pressure to track statistics. But at the perfect moment, its band teared off, so I retired it and didn’t want to think about smartwatches anymore.

              When I was little, I liked watching Pink Panther. I got a bit nostalgic this week when I saw it recommended to me on YouTube, and with the original episodes too.
It might be a good fit to play it at night, along with some lo-fi.

              After the summer passed and the flights to my city stopped, it was time to find another way of traveling to Sofia, and since I hate buses – train it is.
The lack of funding and corruption has made the railways here a last resort of travel.

              This year I’ve been finishing Seinfeld and this week I want to share one of my top favourite episodes – the one with the Merv Griffin Show.
I don’t know who he was, but this episode is one of the best.

              Obsidian is my note-taking app that I plan to use as a personal wiki, and also a bit more like a second brain. I’m a big Bear fan, and I still plan to keep using it, but as a place where I can scribble notes quickly.

              Cautionary Tales is another podcast that I found out after an episode of it was shared on 99% Invisible. I instantly loved the idea.
As the name suggest, it’s about learning from mistakes. Often the stories presented there are about how people had an idea, or good intentions about something they built, but then learning that they didn’t have the whole picture, and their idea might be a bad one.

              I’ve never counted calories, well, I tried just once for a minute, but it sounded impossible to be able to track everything, so I just gave up straight away.
Now, I got back to working out actively, but was taken aback by the lack of noticeable progress.

              I learned about Song Exploder on 99% Invisible.
If you love music – this one is big. It’s a podcast where bands and artists talk about how they made a song of their choosing. They “explode” it in its building parts.

              This week’s thing is another great YouTube channel. It’s about a man with a huge beard, doing food challenges around the world, akin to competitive eating. You have a given time to eat the whole challenge in one sitting, and if you do – you can get some kind of reward.

              I didn’t know Snarky Puppy before seeing them mentioned in a video with Larnell Lewis and a note how he learned a bunch of songs on the flight to the live studio.
When I searched for them – the primary results were from a live recording for GroundUP Music.

              I’ve kept this for some years, and because this week has been a bit slow, maybe it’s time to share it as a thing of the week. It’s probably my favourite space related speech. It was given by NASA’s Anne McClain when the first SpaceX Crew Dragon docket to the International Space Station.

              There was a time when August in my city was crazy. We had a music festival, and it was one of the biggest events on the country’s calendar, especially in the summer. Of course, with time, money, and politics got involved, and the festival died.

              The thing of this week is another great YouTube channel. It’s Carbot Animations.
They produce very creative and funny animated videos of various games. Their style is pretty unique. I love very much the Elden Ring series.

              There is a type of TV show episodes that I like very much – the ones when the characters are in a confined space for the entirety of the episode. They are very rare because they hard to write and pull off I think, but often the result is great.

              About a year ago, I was searching for a workout that works the abs, and is also interesting to do. I don’t like planks and all the basic ab workouts that are actually effective, but tedious to do.

              I’m a big fan of the hip-hop lo-fi remixes, but this week I got a surprise recommendation from YouTube – a lo-fi remix of MF Doom’s work.
Maybe it’s related to a search I did because right now, I’m in a bit of MF Doom phase, but either way the remix is pretty great.

              I had a bit of a busy week, so instead of something meaningful, I’ll just embed my video of riding a Lime scooter in Frankfurt.

              Historically, Fringe is one of my favourite TV shows. So, the minute I noticed that it was added to HBO Max – I checked out a few of my favourite episodes, which grew into quickly (with skips) rewatching the whole series in 2 weeks.

              The spring is slowly giving up to the summer, and my favourite thing right now is going out to bike to some place and grab lunch from it. I still eat it at home while watching some TV show, but going out in the nice weather, around people, and including a mild workout in it, is a pretty good way to relieve the monotony of working from home.

              Another great YouTube recommendation. I’ve been listening jazz from time to time, but I’m not really deep into it. This week I got recommended the “dirtiest trombone solo”. It’s from Wycliffe Gordon.

              It’s hard to start describing this game. It’s grand, it’s massive. It’s absorbing. It’s the best open-world game right now. If I could describe it in two sentences – Elden Ring is an open-world, souls-like game.

A few months ago I tried it again, but I didn’t like how it was broken on my 4k monitor, and because I couldn’t find a way to fix it or make it better, I just gave up.

              Unsurprisingly, I got into chess after watching Queen’s Gambit. Well, I started playing a week before watching the TV show, but it was in preparation for the show, so I can say that it was because of it.

              I had Queen’s Gambit on my watch list for a while. I was pleasantly surprised that a TV show about chess is getting appraisals, so I thought I better add it for some free weekend in the future.

              I don’t know how to explain Years and Years. I’d say it’s lightweight Black Mirror as a base, but it’s also pretty different in some ways.
The idea of following a group of people for many “years and years” is new for me, and I liked it a lot.

              I’ve been wanting to have colourful lights for quite some time. As a lo-fi enjoyer, having your home in neon blue light is a must.
When the time to invest in this came, I watched many reviews on YouTube that were all saying that I don’t need to pay for Philips Hue.

              Watching comedy on YouTube is one of my guilty pleasures. So, here comes another favourite of mine - KillaKayTV.
His sketches are one of the most original I’ve seen, because of his ability to portray every role in life – Mother, Salesmen, Barber, Walmart worker, Teacher, the list goes on.

              A tradition to have when you finish a souls game, is to check the funny PVP videos, the speed run record, and the no hit run videos.
The last one is something new to me because I didn’t know such self-torture exists, but I guess the world is full of all kinds of wonderful people.

              As a big music fan, I’ve always wondered what people outside or in public transport are listening. Many times, judging them from outside, it’s not what you expected. That’s why the “what are you listening to” videos are this thing of the week for me.

              I’m big on nostalgia, so the closer we got to the release, I couldn’t wait to relive my childhood of playing Diablo 2: LoD almost non-stop.
Of course, having a gamer ego now and not playing 100% for the fun of it, I decided to play on hardcore mode.

Maybe one of the reasons, is the pressure that comes off with how Habitica is set. You either complete the task, or you get a penalty for skipping it.

              At this point, there is not much more to say about Dark Souls that is not already said. A genre defining game that is interesting, very challenging, very punishing, greatly satisfying after your first 100 deaths, and a world building that compliments the story in a perfect way.

              There’s rarely any video that encompasses that amount of things I like — games, hip-hop, lo-fi, and a hint of nostalgia. It’s like a Venn diagram tailored to me. I found this mix a year ago, but just now I get to share it, along with the playlist.

              After more than 20 years of now owning a bike, I finally felt the need to buy myself one. I use it mainly for cycling with friends, but I can attest that it’s also a good workout replacement if I skip my rowing for some reason.

              TV shows and movies can best represent the times they’ve made in, so it’s always interesting to watch episodes that satirise or give a funny twist to a real life events. For those like me which are just now watching South Park episodes that were made 10 years ago for example — it’s funny how sometimes I don’t really get the context of the story because they reference events that I haven’t followed at the time the episode was aired.

              One of my favourite channels on YouTube. It’s hard to explain, so I guess a good starting point is this video although some may prefer jumping straight into some of their best work.

              Nostalgia would be a prevalent topic in these journal-like series, so this great video by Vsauce is unsurprisingly the thing of the week.
It’s a 30-minute masterpiece on how people perceive time. Aside from constantly making you ask yourself “Am I really that old now” it presents research and terms to explain for example, why it seems that time goes faster as we age, and our own biases when we think about events that happened in the past.

              Surprise surprise! Another week, another productivity thingy.
I&rsquo;ve probably read about brain.fm in Engadget because I remember trying it at work for a while, without being that much impressed, although every time I listen to this wonderful track they&rsquo;ve put for free on YouTube, I think about checking it again.

This week&rsquo;s thing is an app called Forest, which as kind of popular and I&rsquo;m late to the party but I just found out how it can help me.

              I was a strong opponent to writing on paper, I&rsquo;ve tried a plethora of to-do apps, used an erasable &ldquo;smart notebook&rdquo;, bought a touch screen pen, there was even a time that I was worried that I won&rsquo;t be able to fill legal documents right (that bad) but it wasn&rsquo;t until I decided to buy myself a Fountain Pen as a gift (inspired from a subreddit about fountain pens) that I turned my mind around paper.

              Around 7 years ago when I was already deep down in the jungle of becoming a self-taught software engineer, I don&rsquo;t remember how, but I&rsquo;ve stumbled on checkio. At that time it had support only for Python (my first language).

  Over the last few years, I&rsquo;ve always been taking days off work for specific reasons, mostly traveling and concerts.
So, something strange happened in late July and August that caught me by surprise.

              It took me a few summers to decide, but I&rsquo;ve finally bought myself a longboard 😲
Aside from turning my legs into jelly the next day and making my other workouts harder, it&rsquo;s a great way to cruise around and hype to a hip-hop bangers.

              Let&rsquo;s see if I&rsquo;m able to explain this game.
It&rsquo;s a battle-royal kind of game where you start with 59 other players and try to get to the finish line or not get knocked out of a platform.

  Time has finally come for the second &ldquo;thing of the week&rdquo; about tooling.
Over the years I&rsquo;ve bookmarked various services which provide quality and free illustrations (perfect for side projects) and it wasn&rsquo;t until this month that I finally used one of them for a project I&rsquo;ve been working on.

              A nostalgic one.
I actually don&rsquo;t remember what reminded me to search videos about Vice City, but for sure I&rsquo;m thankful I did.
Probably everybody that played this game has memories of driving a car around while listening to the quality made radio stations.

  I&rsquo;ve been working out three times a week for more 10 months now, but it wasn&rsquo;t until I moved to a stricter diet and daily workouts, that I found out how fun and important cheat reward days can be.

              This is a video I&rsquo;ve been keeping for a long time because as a someone who rarely had any interest in school besides sports, it speaks deeply to me.
Of course, some of the ideas presented in the video are not a silver bullet for the perfect learning experience, but I like the mindset from which they are coming.

              Here&rsquo;s the main reason that I was late on so many things in the late summer. After a long chain of events, a massive protests erupted in Bulgaria, and for those who are far away from Eastern Europe - this is a huge deal.

              Here we go, the game you now hate while playing, but love while not. The main source of nostalgia for millions of people, and one of the reasons I skipped writing a couple of posts here, because I was busy levelling and gearing my new Death Knight.

              This week I want to drop a huge thanks to the people who create the underground Hip-hop mixes on YouTube.
Hip-hop is probably one of the few music genres where you can pinpoint with a high precision where and when it started.

              I haven&rsquo;t played No Man&rsquo;s Sky yet, mainly because I don&rsquo;t have where, but if you are following game news at least at the basic level - you probably have heard of the hype around the release of No Man&rsquo;s Sky, the harsh criticism that it didn&rsquo;t live up to its promised gameplay, and then its near heroic return, with a couple of really successful patches.

              This week&rsquo;s issue is about the thing that made the most impact on my productivity in the last year.
Few months ago I had one of these days where I was in a mood to give chances to todo apps I haven&rsquo;t tried yet (the list was shrinking).

I will probably sound like one of these cheesy TV shop commercials that want you to call in the next 5 minutes for a great deal, but hear me out. Chance is you&rsquo;ve already seen this tool in the newsletters you follow.
