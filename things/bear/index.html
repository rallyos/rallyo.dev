<p>I remember <a href="https://bear.app">Bear</a> was getting popular at the time that Evernote had its first massive pushback.</p>

<p>Someone at Evernote decided that people want more AI in their notes, which unsurprisingly turned out to be wrong and drove some people out of their platform. I liked some features of Evernote but was never hard set on using it. I already had some reasons to switch - it was expensive, and the app looked a bit more corporate and complex for my use case. So that little mashup at the time was enough for me to look for other options. And I quickly found about <a href="https://bear.app">Bear</a>.</p>

<p>It covered most of the requirements I have about the apps I use:<br />
- ✅ Minimal design<br />
- ✅ Independent or small company<br />
- ✅ Simple product with simple features</p>

<p>I can’t recommend <a href="https://bear.app">Bear</a> for taking too complex and work-related notes (depends on the field), but I will highly recommend it for everything else. It’s easy to use, syncs across all devices (Apple Ecosystem only, sorry), it has a tagging system, it’s markdown centric, it’s cheap, and it’s beautiful.</p>

<p>Bear is my daily note taking driver for more than 2 years now. I use it on 3 devices. I back up and organise my notes every week. Every idea starts there. The knowledge surrounding every project that I work on is managed there. I plan everything around my life there. And I’m not leaving it anytime soon.</p>
