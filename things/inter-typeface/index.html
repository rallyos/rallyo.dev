<p>A few years I back I loved to check what font people used for their site, I even had browser extension for this purpose, it could tell me the font just by pointing to the text I was interested in.</p>

<p>Now I rarely need this kind of information, so I lost interest, the internet is full of Roboto font variants anyway.</p>

<p>A few weeks back though, I was in the look for design ideas about one of my projects, and I stumbled on that great design that used the macOS San Francisco Round typeface, which not surprisingly can’t be used for a non-apple related stuff. I remember I did a few google checks for alternatives, checked recommended fonts and then disappointingly settled on some variant of Roboto.</p>

<p>As the early look of my project was getting more finished, the font was probably the main thing that bothered me.<br />
I continued to check how cool it could’ve looked if I could use the font I wanted. Now, luckily this prompted me to do another search for similar typefaces, this time I changed the wording a bit, which after a few clicks, lead me to an old and closed stackoverflow question on the same topic. This time there was an answer with actual font recommendation — <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/">Inter</a>.</p>

<p>It looked so beautiful, and exactly the look I searched with SanFrancisco Rounded before that. I remember anxiously scrolling to find a price tag of $80 or something, but nope, there was nothing about price on that page. It is free!</p>

<p>Going forward to now — I am a happy user, I use it on two projects, I plan to even use it for my new resume.</p>

<p>The typeface was created by <a href="https://rsms.me">https://rsms.me</a>.<br />
Mad props to him for the great work.</p>
