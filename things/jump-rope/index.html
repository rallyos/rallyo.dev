         <p>About a year ago, I was searching for a workout that works the abs, and is also interesting to do. I don’t like planks and all the basic ab workouts that are actually effective, but tedious to do.</p>

<p>Somewhere I saw jump ropes being mentioned, and because of the way it’s practiced, it sounded plausible as a good and appealing ab workout.</p>

<p>I instantly bought jump ropes, and to add to that – weighted jump ropes. I received them and made plans to go jump at the beach early in the morning, but I couldn’t get early enough, so I actually gave up. Thinking that I’ll need time to get used to it, and I’ll look silly in the beginning, I wanted to go out when there are fewer people to see me. Once I realised how hard it will be to do in the early morning, I moved on to just skating, and put the ropes in the drawer.</p>

<p>A year passed and I revisited them again. Since I couldn’t get up early when there will be fewer people outside, I thought – why not just go at sunset? The first night was a bit bitter-sweet because I was greeted by the mosquitoes, but I was able to see that it’s actually easy, and I required no more than an hour to get used to it.</p>

<p>One week in – I can say that it’s a pretty cool workout. Especially with a weighted rope, I can feel the burn pretty quick. I have a feeling that it might become my new favourite workout, and finally a routine one I can do outside and on the beach specifically. I am tired of rowing in my room.</p>
