      <description>I recently watched 12 monkeys, which had scenes with some pretty cool futuristic steampunk props, which I really liked. This made me look up into the other work of the director, that’s where I saw Brazil.</description>

      <description>I’ve already mentioned Song Exploder – a nice podcast where songs are “exploded” in parts, by the artists themselves.
This week, I listened to their last album, which reminded me of one of the best episodes of Song Exploder – the one about “All Over Now” from that exact album.</description>

      <description>With nothing notable to share, and as I wait for the weather to fix itself, this week’s thing is the Diablo 4 beta.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago, I watched Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver. It is a bit of an atmospheric film with some dark spots here and there, but to me, it’s one of the best portrays of being lonely in a big city.</description>

      <description>This week’s thing is my helper in writing these posts. The Ulysses app.
Originally, I was an iA Writer user, but for some purposes it became a bit limited for me.</description>

      <description>Pressing play on Mad Max: Fury Road yesterday I definitely didn’t expect such movie. I wanted to watch it because I saw it in some letterboxd lists about world building and aesthetic.</description>

      <description>This week’s thing is this video about February. I always looked at it as the most boring winter month, but this video made me even hate it a bit.</description>

      <description>I added Severance to my watch list the moment I saw the trailer. I had no doubt it will be good because the idea, at least for me, was unheard of.</description>

      <description>This week I found about a Spotify feature that I didn’t know existed.
I was listening to a Spotify made electronic playlist and started to notice that songs just don’t end.</description>

      <description>I was reluctant to check Disney Plus when it became available because I thought it’s all Marvel, Star Wars, and animations, but I was wrong.</description>

      <guid>https://rallyo.io/things/malenia-on-dance-pad-and-controller/</guid>
      <description>I’ve seen no hit runs and other challenges that people like to torture themselves with, but for the first time I saw someone playing the game not only in two parallel versions, but also with different controllers.</description>

      <description>I was never a movie buff. I rarely missed a good sci-fi, but I’ve always been more of a TV shows guy.</description>

      <description>It’s the holidays. I usually have several Christmas lo-fi videos that I listen to for the mood, but this year I had a new idea – find retro Christmas commercials – and play them as a background to the music.</description>

      <guid>https://rallyo.io/things/philip-dick-electric-dreams/</guid>
      <description>I’ve read two Philip K. Dick books, so knowing at least partially what to expect, I was excited when I saw that someone is about to make a TV show out of his stories.</description>

      <description>It’s a tradition to mention comedy YouTube channels I follow, so here’s another one – Trey Kennedy.
He definitely has a unique niche in the comedy part of YouTube.</description>

      <description>This year, I have a new favourite dream pop band (at least that’s how I categorise them). I don’t know where I heard them, probably a Spotify radio recommendation, but I kept a song from them in my skating playlist, until discovering more of them.</description>

      <description>Atlas Obscura I discovered as a podcast first, of course, being featured on 99% invisible. Later I found out that the podcast is just part of their service – providing exploration of “the hidden wonders of the world”.</description>

      <description>One of the news outlets that I follow shared this video of a championship game between Ipswich and Charlton, that was going 2:2 in the regular time, but then it got to 4:4 in the stoppage time of 6 (8) minutes.</description>

      <description>When I was little, I liked watching Pink Panther. I got a bit nostalgic this week when I saw it recommended to me on YouTube, and with the original episodes too.</description>

      <description>From speaking with other people too, I can say that these weeks there is a channel on YouTube that is recommended to many people.</description>

      <description>Historically, Fringe is one of my favourite TV shows. So, the minute I noticed that it was added to HBO Max – I checked out a few of my favourite episodes, which grew into quickly (with skips) rewatching the whole series in 2 weeks.</description>

      <description>So, r/place is back again. It’s maybe the best, if not one of the best April Fools&amp;rsquo; Day events. The first one was 4 years ago, and the idea was that on this one reddit, you’ll be shown a massive canvas, where you can place 1 pixel of some colour, wherever you choose.</description>

      <description>Unsurprisingly, I got into chess after watching Queen’s Gambit. Well, I started playing a week before watching the TV show, but it was in preparation for the show, so I can say that it was because of it.</description>

      <description>Watching comedy on YouTube is one of my guilty pleasures. So, here comes another favourite of mine - KillaKayTV.
His sketches are one of the most original I’ve seen, because of his ability to portray every role in life – Mother, Salesmen, Barber, Walmart worker, Teacher, the list goes on.</description>

A genre defining game that is interesting, very challenging, very punishing, greatly satisfying after your first 100 deaths, and a world building that compliments the story in a perfect way.</description>

      <description>This one combines two favourite things of mine. Futurism and listening to music before sleep.
There are times that I listen to music in bed to get myself to fall asleep easier.</description>

      <description>A few years I back I loved to check what font people used for their site, I even had browser extension for this purpose, it could tell me the font just by pointing to the text I was interested in.</description>

      <description>Surprise surprise! Another week, another productivity thingy.
I&amp;rsquo;ve probably read about brain.fm in Engadget because I remember trying it at work for a while, without being that much impressed, although every time I listen to this wonderful track they&amp;rsquo;ve put for free on YouTube, I think about checking it again.</description>

      <description>I was a strong opponent to writing on paper, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried a plethora of to-do apps, used an erasable &amp;ldquo;smart notebook&amp;rdquo;, bought a touch screen pen, there was even a time that I was worried that I won&amp;rsquo;t be able to fill legal documents right (that bad) but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until I decided to buy myself a Fountain Pen as a gift (inspired from a subreddit about fountain pens) that I turned my mind around paper.</description>

      <description>Usually I don&amp;rsquo;t have time for podcasts, it&amp;rsquo;s not that I can&amp;rsquo;t find interesting ones, I just don&amp;rsquo;t have the habit of investing time in them I guess.</description>

      <description>It took me a few summers to decide, but I&amp;rsquo;ve finally bought myself a longboard 😲
Aside from turning my legs into jelly the next day and making my other workouts harder, it&amp;rsquo;s a great way to cruise around and hype to a hip-hop bangers.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s see if I&amp;rsquo;m able to explain this game.
It&amp;rsquo;s a battle-royal kind of game where you start with 59 other players and try to get to the finish line or not get knocked out of a platform.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s the main reason that I was late on so many things in the late summer. After a long chain of events, a massive protests erupted in Bulgaria, and for those who are far away from Eastern Europe - this is a huge deal.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t played No Man&amp;rsquo;s Sky yet, mainly because I don&amp;rsquo;t have where, but if you are following game news at least at the basic level - you probably have heard of the hype around the release of No Man&amp;rsquo;s Sky, the harsh criticism that it didn&amp;rsquo;t live up to its promised gameplay, and then its near heroic return, with a couple of really successful patches.</description>
