<p>There was a time when August in my city was crazy. We had a music festival, and it was one of the biggest events on the country’s calendar, especially in the summer. Of course, with time, money, and politics got involved, and the festival died.</p>

<p>The place where it was held is a prime location for music events, so over the years there were some experiments close to the same location, with some smaller and more niche events and festivals. But these never got even closer to what that festival was able to generate in terms of interest and hype.</p>

<p>Well, this year is different. The promoter that experimented with festivals there, invited Arctic Monkeys, one of my (and many other people) favourites. It was big, not because it was their first time in the country, or because we were one of their first few events since the last tour. But because it was the first time that such a big band, more or less in their prime, coming for a solo event in Burgas. There was a lot of hype. As expected, it was painful to get tickets, but through the years we racked up experience with this, so in the end all my friends had tickets.</p>

<p>I’ve already seen them, so I was more hyped about seeing the city being full of “my tribe” again, after so many years without a proper music event. And I wasn’t disappointed. It’s so cool to have your city feel like a capital, even for a day, after usually talked about in terms of being a “province”.</p>

<p>The concert was great. There were countless people. All food places in a radius of few kilometres were blocked after it. I got to relive the Spirit of Burgas times with all my friends, and that was the most important thing for me.</p>
