      <description>I think that the invention of Let’s Encrypt is underrated. I don’t have numbers, but I can guess that it amounted to an increase in knowledge sharing on the web because of its free, easy to use certificates.</description>

      <description>I’ve been a bit lazy on productivity outside work lately. I haven’t been using my Habitica board in months.
Maybe one of the reasons, is the pressure that comes off with how Habitica is set. You either complete the task, or you get a penalty for skipping it.</description>

      <description>Lately, I’ve been a daily listener of Another GTA 5 radio. I prefer to listen to this one around sunset, it has the perfect selection of songs for the end of the workday.</description>

      <description>I am huge fan of The Office. Though I haven’t started to listen the Office Ladies podcast, I love the animated videos they’ve published on YouTube. Makes you wonder if an animated series of the show can work.</description>

      <guid>https://rallyo.io/things/dark-souls/</guid>
      <description>At this point, there is not much more to say about Dark Souls that is not already said. A genre defining game that is interesting, very challenging, very punishing, greatly satisfying after your first 100 deaths, and a world building that compliments the story in a perfect way.</description>

      <guid>https://rallyo.io/things/blade-runner-8-hours/</guid>
      <description>This one combines two favourite things of mine. Futurism and listening to music before sleep.
There are times that I listen to music in bed to get myself to fall asleep easier. But recently, I listen to this 8-hour video that combines Blade Runner Blues from the Blade Runner soundtrack and the sound of constant rain (there is lots of it in the movie).</description>

      <guid>https://rallyo.io/things/3d-printed-simpsons-tv/</guid>
      <description>I saw the coolest thing on reddit this week. A small 3D printed TV that plays The Simpsons episodes at random, without internet.
When I saw it for a first time, it hit me in the feels, because I’m a huge fan of having a device with your favourite tv shows, that you can play without internet.</description>

      <description>Somehow I wasn’t that much hyped about the Olympics. Usually I watch at least some part of it, but for the first half of it, I only took slight interest in rowing, which sadly was never properly aired on TV.</description>

      <description>Another GTA radio is my thing of the week.
This one, as someone can probably guess by the amount of disco, is from GTA Vice City. It has become my daily companion in the last 2 hours of the workday.</description>

      <description>This weekend, I spent more hours that I’m comfortable to share, watching 90s-00s WWE (mostly superstar returns) videos.
This blast of nostalgia I mostly blame on finding this 90s WWE Twitter account. It made me go back and shed some tears about much wrestling I watched when I was a kid (as many others did).</description>

      <description>During the years I’ve been trying various apps for tracking expenses and they all worked fine. They did as advertised. I was using them because I thought seeing what I spend money on, will somehow prevent me from overspending on non-essentials.</description>

      <description>There’s rarely any video that encompasses that amount of things I like — games, hip-hop, lo-fi, and a hint of nostalgia. It’s like a Venn diagram tailored to me. I found this mix a year ago, but just now I get to share it, along with the playlist.</description>

      <guid>https://rallyo.io/things/superstars-arsenio-hall-show/</guid>
      <description>Not much to say about this video. Just a nice piece of history showcasing some the best hip-hop artists ever, together on one scene.</description>

      <description>Not the first time I’ll praise a GTA radio, and probably not the last.
I played GTA 5 a bit this summer (just to finish the story) and maybe the most important thing to come out of that is the discovery of Radio Los Santos.</description>

      <description>There’s a whole corner in YouTube full of nicely done indie documentaries. One such finding is the History of the Earth channel.
I love this channel because its focus is early earth and its extinctions something that is very rare on YouTube, it is probably the only channel I know of that tells these stories in depth.</description>

      <description>After more than 20 years of now owning a bike, I finally felt the need to buy myself one. I use it mainly for cycling with friends, but I can attest that it’s also a good workout replacement if I skip my rowing for some reason.</description>

      <description>TV shows and movies can best represent the times they’ve made in, so it’s always interesting to watch episodes that satirise or give a funny twist to a real life events. For those like me which are just now watching South Park episodes that were made 10 years ago for example — it’s funny how sometimes I don’t really get the context of the story because they reference events that I haven’t followed at the time the episode was aired.</description>

      <description>After a year after I wrote about Internet Historian: Engoodening of No Mans Sky. I finally have some play time in it.
Initially, I was very invested in the game. I played it for non-stop for a couple of days.</description>

      <description>It’s here, the most awaited scientific product recently - the COVID vaccine. I got my first shot recently and I’m kind of hyped about the opportunities that it will open for me. I’ll finally feel safe to travel to Sofia to see my friends there.</description>

      <guid>https://rallyo.io/things/all-gas-no-brakes/</guid>
      <description>One of my favourite channels on YouTube. It’s hard to explain, so I guess a good starting point is this video although some may prefer jumping straight into some of their best work.
I would say it’s a channel documenting the American culture (mostly the bad parts, but hey…there’s people like this everywhere)</description>

      <description>I have listened to some synthwave videos on YouTube, but I have newfound love for them because they mix perfectly in my early morning routine. Every morning that I start wondering what I should listen to - I end up with a nice melancholic synthwave video with a cool futuristic anime scene.</description>

      <description>I have never had a good gaming PC. I always had a normal computer, just enough to run a relatively old game without annoying me, in most of the cases - just enough to play World of Warcraft without major issues.</description>

      <description>Maybe a followup to Elections.
The new parliament swore, and I’m continuing to very much enjoy our “political crisis” as some are over dramatising.
I watch the sessions live when I can, I even watch the sessions of commissions that the parliament forms for every field that requires attention from lawmakers.</description>

      <description>I’ve written on a couple of occasions about the current political situation in Bulgaria.
The whole summer I couldn’t wait for new elections to come, and I definitely didn’t expect them to be on their regular date.</description>

      <description>I have a new favourite twitter profile.

      <description>I have a soft spot for catchy basslines. That’s why I got addicted to Be Sweet by Japanese Breakfast the moment I heard it (thank you Pitchfork). It’s such a summerish song, I can’t wait to hear the whole album in June.</description>

      <description>I won’t get into much details on this.
I don’t watch late night shows, but I binge watched most of the Conan remotes on YouTube in the span of 3 days. The majority them are very funny and the places they choose to film are very interesting.</description>

      <description>For those that do it often (1-2 years), there are few things more enjoyable for a software engineer, than learning a new programming language.
I started learning Rust this week and was again reminded of the nice and warm feeling you get from playing with a new language.</description>

      <description>I’m a little late to the NF party, some of my friends were talking about him two years ago, but sometimes I don’t believe the hype.

      <description>This game has a special place in my heart:
- It was my way to cope with the first 2020 lockdown. I played it 12+ hours a day for a few weeks straight. Aside from some stressful runs, it was a great distraction that kept me from reading covid news all day (I allowed myself to check news only during dinner)</description>

      <description>Some people hate the so-called algorithmic code challenges, probably because of their overuse in interviews, but to be fair - I love like them.
I have my portion of failed interviews because of an unsolved code challenge, so I see how one can be against them, or even feel stressed out just from opening Leetcode.</description>

      <description>I am writing this many weeks later after the events transpired, so this “thingy” would lose its emotional parts, but this may be for good.
I have had this approach to job hunting where I would choose a company purely based on values and then try to tailor my resume and tech stack to give me a better chance, as I am fluid about the programming languages I use.</description>

      <description>Nostalgia would be a prevalent topic in these journal-like series, so this great video by Vsauce is unsurprisingly the thing of the week.
It’s a 30-minute masterpiece on how people perceive time. Aside from constantly making you ask yourself “Am I really that old now” it presents research and terms to explain for example, why it seems that time goes faster as we age, and our own biases when we think about events that happened in the past.</description>

      <description>Darkest Dungeon is an indie game I bought on a cyber Monday discount, after seeing in a couple of streams and reading how unforgiving it is (I’m an FTL veteran, I like such games).</description>

      <description>I love watching videos about open source engineers and their projects.
Often I will have one of these days where it’s plain hard to motivate myself to work on my projects, or some chore (especially if it’s not that interesting and it feels more like a boring chore).</description>

      <description>I’ve watched many of the binaural city walk around city X videos, but it wasn’t until this year’s pandemic that made me fully appreciate them.
If you are in lockdown, can’t travel, and feeling nostalgic about a place you miss — watching such videos can fill that void.</description>

Someone at Evernote decided that people want more AI in their notes, which unsurprisingly turned out to be wrong and drove some people out of their platform.</description>

      <description>A little more than a year ago, after a fun 5-year ride, I left Melon.
It wasn’t a spur of the moment decision, but something that I was planning for almost 2 years. In the end it was just hard to leave my colleagues (which I now call friends).</description>
