<p>After the release of the early Bookmarko version, I started to look around for the next idea that would be interesting to be made and also to help me learn some new developer tools. That&rsquo;s why my approach was more &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see how this will work&rdquo; than to make a full working app. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that I was not paying attention to every detail.</p>

<h2 id="some-technical-stuff">Some technical stuff</h2>

<p>This time for REST framework I wanted to try TastyPie. I spent day or two playing with it and reading the docs, but then I decided to go back to django-rest-framework because I thought that it&rsquo;s easy to set up and use. Later I found that I was used to how things were in the old version of django-rest, and the new one isn&rsquo;t that different from TastyPie when it comes to simple api setup. Anyway I decided to use it for this project. Maybe I will use TastyPie another time. Huge props to the creators of both.</p>

<p>On client side I decided to use Angular instead Backbone which I am using for Bookmarko. Things started very tough. If your only experience with js frameworks is Backbone, then prepare for crash when you meet Angular. Services, Directives, Factories, it was a whole new world to learn and play with.</p>

<p>The danger of learning a second framework is that you will always say things like &ldquo;This was more easy with the first one&rdquo; and you can easily be ignorant to the advantages that this new tool gives you.</p>

<p>I had troubles with many things that are not obvious in the beginning and personally I am not a big fan of templating (I still like my HTML to be clean and easy to read). It looked that I will need time to get the whole feeling of how things should be done in Angular way.
So after a couple of days trying to build the app with Angular, I gave up and made a fresh start, this time with Backbone.</p>

<p>After couple of hours rewriting everything with Backbone, I was trying to write some simple app functionality, but easily the code started to look a bit messy. I was constantly thinking how this can be done in Angular with only a few words or lines. My biggest need for this project was to update simultaneously separate parts of the app. This was very easy with the two-way data binding that Angular has, I thought. Then I realized that I don&rsquo;t want to make this app without the help of data binding, the &lsquo;change&rsquo; event in Backbone wasn&rsquo;t enough for me. I decided not to search how to do it in Backbone but return again to Angular with more confidence.
Now as I release the early beta, I can say that Angular is great. In some cases will be hard to learn, but it saves a lot of time.</p>

<h2 id="simple-is-great">Simple is great</h2>

<p>There isn&rsquo;t much to say about how I designed the app, except that I wanted to make the interface as simple as it can be. Showing only what&rsquo;s important to the user in combination with simple interface elements and a lot of white space. Another important goal was to animate every interaction with the app, I think that if the user manipulates something, there should be a visible feedback, this is how things work in our world.</p>

<p>This is in short what I think was interesting to mention for this small project.</p>
