<p>Months before I started Tuesday(The WordPress theme), I was thinking about ideas for a serious project and most of the time the word that was coming to my mind was Bookmarking.</p>

<p>At this time, when I find something interesting on the internet, I had to open gmail and send the links to myself. As bad as it sounds that was my way to save things for later. I don&rsquo;t like how browsers handle bookmarks. It&rsquo;s messy, and the functionality is very limited, but I have to admit that now some browsers are trying to make things better. I also tried to find some bookmarking services, but all of them were like social networks and that is not what I need.</p>

<p>So it should come to no surprise that I hugged the bookmarking idea. This is the time when Bookmarko comes in.</p>

<h2 id="in-the-beginning">In the beginning</h2>

<p>When I started this project I didn&rsquo;t have any intentions to use App Engine and Python to code it. I had little experience with PHP, so obviously that was my choice of language. I just found Laravel and thought to give it a try, and it was looking nicer than Codeigniter.</p>

<p>After some experiments with Laravel, I decided to put the project on hold until I finish the other projects that I was working on, so I can focus properly on Bookmarko.</p>

<h2 id="learn-by-doing">Learn by doing</h2>

<p>Couple of months later I began to work on it again, and I was starting to rethink the whole process of developing and releasing it. I had some concerns about scaling it and I didn&rsquo;t want to put money in it, at least in the beta testing process. At that time App Engine was free to test ( And it had to stay that way :( ), but it didn&rsquo;t have PHP support. I checked Amazon too, and after a small comparison between the two, I chose App Engine because of the developer community. I thought it will be easy to learn and work with it.</p>

<p>I wondered will I have time to learn a new language and framework and wouldn&rsquo;t that slow me, but I accepted it as a challenge. At that time I only knew that Python has a really clean and nice syntax.</p>

<p>To be fair it was pretty easy to start, Django has a very good documentation. I just had some problems returning data, but I found django-rest-framework which fixed them.
On the other side Django makes it so easy to build sites with Python, that I thought I didn&rsquo;t know Python well enough. So I decided to develop a little framework from scratch to improve my knowledge. It did not happen as I thought, but that is a whole other story.</p>

<h2 id="interface">Interface</h2>

<p>Current interface is not that different from the image that I had in my head before starting the project. Sidebar with groups, top header with buttons for various functions, large search field and a list of saved sites.</p>

<p>Initially I planned to make just one bookmarks view, a list. I still had no idea how to design the others. But through the developing process I started experimenting for fun, and I really liked the grid of &lsquo;card&rsquo; like items.
The card shows more information about the saved site, it gives nicer look to the user&rsquo;s collection, and the page is easier to adapt for mobile devices.</p>

<p>I strongly believe that most of the actions that user performs in an app should be animated. It&rsquo;s a whole different experience when you see that card that you just deleted to shrink or move the left and disappear. So I put extra effort in implementing this experience into the app for almost every action.</p>

<p>Another important thing that I am focused on is creating an easy to use non-desktop version of the web app. In the early days maybe it will have more bugs than normal, but it will get better over time.</p>

<h2 id="in-the-near-future">In the near future</h2>

<p>If I use web service for managing bookmarks I will want from it to provide simple, but useful features served with nice and minimal design and something special, something that will make managing 300+ bookmarks more easy.</p>

<p>At the time I write this, Bookmarko is something close to beta, but it&rsquo;s not yet released, and it&rsquo;s not the service that I want to be, and maybe won&rsquo;t be even in a year or three. I plan to add many features, most of them will be based on productivity and user experience in the app.</p>
