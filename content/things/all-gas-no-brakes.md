[![LA Punk Show][image-1]][1]

One of my favourite channels on YouTube. It’s hard to explain, so I guess a good starting point is [this video][2] although some may prefer jumping straight into [some of their best work][3].  
  
I would say it’s a channel documenting the American culture (mostly the bad parts, but hey…[there’s people like this everywhere][4])

Once you watch [one of them][5] you can’t stop yourself from binging the [whole thing][6].

I’m happy that someone is preserving what some people in late 2010s and early 2020s [cared about][7]. It could be a [fun, side homework][8], for history study in the future.
