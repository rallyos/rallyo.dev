I think that the invention of [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) is underrated. I don’t have numbers, but I can guess that it amounted to an increase in knowledge sharing on the web because of its free, easy to use certificates. If not that – at least definitely made setting up blogs and static pages way cheaper.

I highly recommend giving a listen to [this episode of The Changeling (one of my favourite podcasts)](https://changelog.com/podcast/243), about Let’s Encrypt. Affordable and easy to set up encryption is big. One of the biggest things to happen to the internet in the past 10 years.
