[![Tenet - Opera Siege](https://img.youtube.com/vi/g7gPegf76Mw/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/g7gPegf76Mw)

I watched Tenet a bit late, as it always happens with films, but it’s better late than never, right?
The movie is great. The new twist on time travel is definitely a welcome one. The music score is another Zimmer great, keeping you on edge through the whole story.

I have a bit of an issue with how unnecessary the budget probably gets blown, just to show us beautiful landscapes from all around the world, but that’s my only tiny gripe with it.

The ending 30 minutes were crazy, and the whole buildup to it is not surprising.

Certainly, a recommendation from me.
