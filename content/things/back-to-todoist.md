Quick follow-up to the [previous to-do app thing of the week](/things/back-to-things3). That I’m now back to Todoist, and maybe considering using it seriously for a first time.

A few months ago I tried it again, but I didn’t like how it was broken on my 4k monitor, and because I couldn’t find a way to fix it or make it better, I just gave up.

These weeks though, I’ve been using it more and more, after watching some [Keep Productive](https://www.youtube.com/@keepproductive) videos, I decided to give it yet another try. I prefer native apps, but just there’s something about Things 3 that feels bland and slow to me. I have to navigate and click way more, to do things that are done better in Todoist. And of course, setting dates in Todoist is way more intuitive, not to mention recurring tasks.

I’ve laid down my project nicely, and it feels that I’m back at Todoist and not planning to leave anytime soon. At least, I do hope so, because it’s annoying to switch workflows often. Wasting time on apps is the opposite of what you want from a productivity system.
