[![World of Warcraft The Danish National Symphony Orchestra](https://img.youtube.com/vi/PU5PvnPiL7A/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/PU5PvnPiL7A)

As someone who grew up playing all Warcraft related games, the world and the story are highly emotional and nostalgic for me. I stumbled upon this video of The Danish National Symphony Orchestra playing some Warcraft & World of Warcraft pieces and hit me pretty hard, so this is my thing of the week.
