[![Blade Runner Blues - Rain 8 Hours](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ypJHCm0Omao/hqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ypJHCm0Omao)

This one combines two favourite things of mine. Futurism and listening to music before sleep.

There are times that I listen to music in bed to get myself to fall asleep easier. But recently, I listen to this 8-hour video that combines Blade Runner Blues from the Blade Runner soundtrack and the sound of constant rain (there is lots of it in the movie).

Itâ€™s great to fall asleep to, I recommend it.
