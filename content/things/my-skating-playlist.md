I have more than 150 Spotify playlists. I love making them so much, that not only I have one for almost every occasion, but often I have more than one because with time I find new music that might fit better.

Many of them I haven’t played in a while, or are just kept for nostalgia purposes, but I have tenths of favourite ones. A late night lo-fi one, a sunny day one, the list goes on and on.

But I can say with pride, that my favourite playlist in the recent year is the one I play when I’m skating on the beach.

Since I’m going for a more upbeat summer-ish mood, it’s mostly dream pop, shoe gaze and a bit of hip-hop. I love that playlist so much. Every time I’m skating with it, I feel like the main character of a generic scene TV show scene revolving around a generic beach street, surrounded by palm trees.

It’s probably the only playlist that I want to promote as much as I can. It’s a huge mood booster, especially on a sunny day. I can’t go out with my board without it. And I still add songs to it regularly.
