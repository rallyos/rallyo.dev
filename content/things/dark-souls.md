At this point, there is not much more to say about Dark Souls that is not already said. A genre defining game that is interesting, very challenging, very punishing, greatly satisfying after your first 100 deaths, and a world building that compliments the story in a perfect way.

For some reason Lately, I played games to prove to myself (probably boost ego) that I can finish them on highest difficulty. In 2020 did hardcore Minecraft, and all achievements and difficulties on FTL: Faster Than Light.

I had Dark Souls on my radar for a while, so the moment that I was in the mood to start a new game – I jumped into it with very minimal preparation.

So, now that I’ve finished it – I’ve never played a game that is so equally frustrating and enjoyable. I had major issues with some zones, fought some bosses for hours, but after the whole thing I became a huge Dark Souls fan. Now, on to the rest of the series.
