[![Seinfeld Trailer](https://img.youtube.com/vi/hQXKyIG_NS4/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/hQXKyIG_NS4)

I’ve only been hearing about Seinfeld, since it didn’t reach massive popularity in Bulgaria that it had in other places. At some point, I noticed that Netflix bought the rights for it and made plans to see it soon, and I’m happy that I finally did.

I love the humour, but mostly I love the 90s setup.
Watching a TV show where people’s phones were attached to a landline. See them having to arrange meetings on specific time and place, with the risk of not finding each other, is so refreshing to see in 2021. It is a bit sad comparing it to now, when you are expected to be available 24/7 for the most unimportant things.

The characters are nicely done. The jokes still hit good even 30 years after they were written. I already suspect that it will be my favourite pre 2000s sitcom.
