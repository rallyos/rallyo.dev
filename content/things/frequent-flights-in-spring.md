![AT75 Plane](/img/propeller.jpg)

This week I’m celebrating that another company started flying between Burgas and Sofia, and not only in the summer. Which was great news because I’m done using buses. And it’s just in time that I had to start to travel monthly again.

They operate AT75 for their short flights, so that was my first propeller-driven flight. It was almost as noisy as I expected, but apart from that – perfect flight. I hope they continue to service the line outside the summer because quick transport is essential for any country.
