[![Dirtiest Trombole Solo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/lTLA4kKXzE8/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/lTLA4kKXzE8)

Another great YouTube recommendation. I’ve been listening jazz from time to time, but I’m not really deep into it. This week I got recommended the “dirtiest trombone solo”. It’s from Wycliffe Gordon.

If you are fan of the piece, you’ll enjoy a video [from the whole concert](https://youtu.be/pEMC_2ZcOJY). It’s a great listen and I wish there were more accessible jazz concerts on the web.
