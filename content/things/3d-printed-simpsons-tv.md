I saw the coolest thing on reddit this week. [A small 3D printed TV that plays The Simpsons episodes at random, without internet.](https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/p9lasb/i_designed_and_printed_a_working_simpsons_tv/)

When I saw it for a first time, it hit me in the feels, because Iâ€™m a huge fan of having a device with your favourite tv shows, that you can play without internet. I am yet to try to download and archive my favourite shows for this same reason.

Hopefully I can build one for myself some day.
