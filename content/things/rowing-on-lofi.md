[![lofi beats to row along to](https://img.youtube.com/vi/UpuuQjeyr6Y/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/UpuuQjeyr6Y)

I’ve been rowing on the indoor concept2 rower for a few years, with some extensive breaks. In the recent months I’ve started working out again, and I have a new favourite background music for doing so.

It is from the [Dark Horse Rowing channel on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@DarkHorseRowing). Probably the best source out there, to improve your rowing technique and motivation.

It works nice to follow your pace and get more focused into the workout, with a few motivational words poking here and there through the songs. Sometimes, just the sounds from the machine can motivate you into working out, if you don't feel 100% like doing so and in a need of a little push.
