[I’ve already mentioned Song Exploder](/things/song-exploder) – a nice podcast where songs are “exploded” in parts, by the artists themselves.

This week, I listened to their last album, which reminded me of [one of the best episodes of Song Exploder – the one about “All Over Now”](https://songexploder.net/the-cranberries) from that exact album.

It’s a bit of a teary-eyed story about how this great song came to be.
