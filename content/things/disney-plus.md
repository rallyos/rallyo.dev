I was reluctant to check Disney Plus when it became available because I thought it’s all Marvel, Star Wars, and animations, but I was wrong.

I wanted to watch a movie that was available only there, so I decided to just get the trial, so I can watch it, and maybe explore a bit how their collection is. And I already heard that they have New Girl, which made me more interested.

Well, now Disney Plus is the thing of this week. They have many shows that I’ve planned to watch, and couldn’t find elsewhere for years. They have plenty of movies that are on my watch list. And most importantly – they have TV shows like Family Guy that I rewatch for years. Family Guy was never available here before that, I had to watch it on some sketchy YouTube streams.

Hopefully, they stay there. I need to re-watch some shows, I also need to see Orville, Futurama, last season of Modern Family and others that I can’t think of right now.

Definitely, this is the service with the biggest concentration of favourite TV shows in one place. I hope they continue to be available.
