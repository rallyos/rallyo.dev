This week’s thing is another great YouTube channel. It’s about a man with a huge beard, doing food challenges around the world, akin to competitive eating. You have a given time to eat the whole challenge in one sitting, and if you do – you can get some kind of reward. It’s called [BeartdMeatsFood](https://www.youtube.com/@Beardmeatsfood)

My description sounds boring, but his videos are hilarious and interesting. I always get an appetite watching him devour various foods in a matter of minutes. The funniest thing is how people react when they see someone eating that much. They are always very surprised and supportive. It’s like we all want to have this talent, although it comes with a lot of practice, and knowing your body.

I also love to see the types of food around the world. I often envy the variety of food places in his videos.
