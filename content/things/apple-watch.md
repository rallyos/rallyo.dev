A while ago, I had a Withings Steel HR, but I started to hate it because of the pressure to track statistics. But at the perfect moment, its band teared off, so I retired it and didn’t want to think about smartwatches anymore.

With the years, I always laughed at the Apple Watch. With having no more than 36 hours of battery, who would want to charge it almost every day. It sounded like an unnecessary commitment to me, especially when there are watches that have better battery life.

This year, though, I slowly started to think about it. Started seeing how people around me use it, but I still wasn’t sold, I was started to think “well, maybe if the next one has a better battery”. Also, I wasn’t ready to go back to health tracking, I had to go into the right headspace for it because I feel pressured to (not to) hyper focus on all the stats it provides.

With the summer passing on, I was getting increasingly sold on the idea, especially when I noticed that there are apps that can track my jump rope hops. That sold it for me, and I decided to wait for the next release.

In the end I after a week long internal fight, I went with the 7 cellular instead of 8 or the Ultra. I could pay less money for the stainless-steel one and spend the rest of the money that I budgeted, on cool bands.

So far, I love it, and I’ve started wondering “how could I live so long without one”? They really made it great with the years. Especially the fitness goals, it’s probably my favourite thing about it, and they’ve made a lot of effort to make it good. If only we had the technology for better batteries, it would’ve been perfect. It’s a minor inconvenience, though.
