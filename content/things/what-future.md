My thing of the week this time is a new podcast from Joshua Topolsky (Engadget, The Verge, and other cool places on the internet). It’s called [What Future](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-what-future-103516818/).  
  
I’ve been following him for many years, so I have no doubt that it will be very intriguing. So far, there were some really great episodes, although there is a bit too much Twitter talk currently (expected though, it’s kind of important).

So far, the [episode with the Midjourney founder](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-what-future-103516818/episode/how-computers-dream-with-david-holz-104410959/) is my favourite, but [the one with The Peripheral’s director](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-what-future-103516818/episode/vincenzo-natalis-peripheral-visions-104745619/) is a second best.

Do follow it, I have no doubt that you will get a lot from it.
