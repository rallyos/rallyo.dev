[![Taxi Driver sax theme](https://img.youtube.com/vi/9fDqFNDnrkY/hqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/9fDqFNDnrkY)

A few weeks ago, I watched Martin Scorseseâ€™s Taxi Driver. It is a bit of an atmospheric film with some dark spots here and there, but to me, itâ€™s one of the best portrays of being lonely in a big city.

From time to time, when my mood is there, I listen to the saxophone theme from the movie. Itâ€™s a good companion when you feel a certain way, and itâ€™s perfect for navigating the city at night. ðŸŒƒ
