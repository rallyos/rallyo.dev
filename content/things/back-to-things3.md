![Things 3](/img/things.png)

I’ve been a bit lazy on productivity outside work lately. I haven’t been using my [Habitica board](/things/habitica) in months.

Maybe one of the reasons, is the pressure that comes off with how Habitica is set. You either complete the task, or you get a penalty for skipping it. Which to be fair was a positive when I had more time, but now it’s plain hard to focus on things in my spare time.

That’s why I got back at using Things 3, which I bought for some of my devices when it got released years ago. On the positive side — seems I can manage my everyday tasks and side projects there (close to impossible to Habitica. It’s not a project management tool) so I will finally have a single place from which I can manage everything that fits into a task, work or personal.

Currently, Things has everything I need to help me get back on track for my goals. It’s also minimalistic and beautiful.
Something I can’t say for Todoist. I tried using it again (3rd or 4th time), I even paid for premium. But I just couldn’t stand some UI issues (somehow using emojis in project names for example doesn’t look good visually). I have tried to make it work many times, but it’s just not my tool somehow. I feel that they have delayed a visual refresh for a too much time now.

Completing a task in Things doesn’t feel as good as before in Habitica. But at least the pressure of logging in every day, and blaming myself when I’m not in a mood to work on a task (or just life happens) is gone. And things can only get better in the future (pun not intended).
