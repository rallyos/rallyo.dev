[![Snarky Puppy - Lingus](https://img.youtube.com/vi/L_XJ_s5IsQc/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/L_XJ_s5IsQc)

I didn’t know Snarky Puppy before seeing them mentioned in a video with Larnell Lewis and a note how he learned a bunch of songs on the flight to the live studio.

When I searched for them – the primary results were from a live recording for GroundUP Music. The videos from there are in my list for best live performance to a small audience. Of course, the studio album has an all-time great status, but I’ve never seen live recording with such attention to details. The camerawork, the relationship between the musicians, the coverups of funny little fails, the things that can happen when you put more than 20 musicians in a room for a fusion jazz live recording.

I recommend watching all videos from that session, there’s a lot to see and hear. Even I wish I were in that room.
