[![Philip K. Dick Electric Dreams trailer](https://img.youtube.com/vi/RtX_LVwEJhA/hqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/RtX_LVwEJhA)

Iâ€™ve read two Philip K. Dick books, so knowing at least partially what to expect, I was excited when I saw that someone is about to make a TV show out of his stories. Especially knowing how much he contributed to the futuristic sci-fi genre. Some of the most loved films are based on his stories.

I watched a few episodes months ago, and this week I had the time to finish the season off. I liked them very much. Most of them.

They were like a combination of a Black Mirror like thriller and the retro unsetting setup of Twilight Zone. I would rather not list favourites, but I think they did a good job of adapting the stories for the modern audience. Some stories were 90% of the original one, some of them less. Still, most of the creative choices they took were good. Definitely a must-watch if you are a fan of his work or a science fiction enjoyer. I wish there were more TV shows in this genre.
