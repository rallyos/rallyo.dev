It’s a tradition to mention comedy YouTube channels I follow, so here’s another one – [Trey Kennedy](https://www.youtube.com/@treykennedy).

He definitely has a unique niche in the comedy part of YouTube. He’s especially good when acting as a woman. His videos are very creative and funny.

My favourites are [The 5 Phases of a Diet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijHLalSh0ns), [The water jug skit at the beginning of this video](https://youtu.be/gInIV94cXto), [Bachelor vs. Bachelorette parties](https://youtu.be/I1561r51M2A), [Girls’ Night vs. Guys’ Night](https://youtu.be/Cf7hioQgeGA), [Girl Problems vs. Guy Problems](https://youtu.be/2G_LgXpyPm8), and way more of them. Do check his channel, it’s lots of fun.
