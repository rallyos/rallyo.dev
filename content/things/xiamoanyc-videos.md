I’m not big on speaking many languages, although always very respectful to do before visiting another country, but I always check the [Xiaomanyc](https://www.youtube.com/@xiaomanyc) videos that YouTube recommends me.

Learning a language (especially a hard one) just to [surprise its speakers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njn6krU3tQ8) that don’t expect you to understand, is always a [funny story to me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r18Ixx4vqU). It leads to [many interesting situations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdSLJnnRDN4).
