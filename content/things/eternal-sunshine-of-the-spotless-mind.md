[![Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind trailer](https://img.youtube.com/vi/07-QBnEkgXU/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/07-QBnEkgXU)

Recently, I [rewatched Maniac](/things/maniac), and I’ve been in search for films or other TV shows that are in the same category. One of the most often recommendations was Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. It was on one of my streaming platforms, so it was an easy play.

I loved it. Of course, I was mostly impressed how the story around the memory deletion was told, through reliving them for one last time. It’s a more sci-fi than drama to me, as the relationship parts were nothing special, but observed through the fact that somebody can delete you from their memory adds a very interesting twist.

100% recommended.
