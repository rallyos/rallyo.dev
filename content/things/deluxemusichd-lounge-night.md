[![Deluxe Music HD - Nightflight - New York](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ZMxZBN_gMn8/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ZMxZBN_gMn8)

One night in a hotel room while I was in Berlin, I found out about the best idea for a night tv show – one that helps you fall asleep. It was on Deluxe Music HD and basically, the idea is that every night after midnight they play chill videos as a good night to the audience. They will play either night flights over some city (mostly NYC) with chill jazz for a background, or a collection of nature clips with similar music.

As a big fan of night music, I’m happy that somebody had this idea, and it’s still going on as far as I know. [Occasionally, I watch the videos on YouTube, when I don’t have any other music ideas.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLZyA2gHObBLuJ4xYdYoAVcgcVBpXCVOk)
