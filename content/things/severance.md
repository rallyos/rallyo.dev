[![Severance trailer](https://img.youtube.com/vi/xEQP4VVuyrY/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/xEQP4VVuyrY)

I added Severance to my watch list the moment I saw the trailer. I had no doubt it will be good because the idea, at least for me, was unheard of. And in the world of reboots, prequels, and sequels, you have to respect creativity.

It’s an Apple TV+ exclusive, and that was a block for me because I pay for plenty of services, but Apple TV+ was never worth it for me. I don’t like their other originals. It’s pretty empty in terms of other TV shows and films. Basically, their fee is definitely on the expensive side, for what they offer.

Apple actually gifts you trials for services you haven’t tried, and luckily, I had to renew almost all of my devices in 2022. With that, I received an Apple TV+ trial, which I planned to use just to see Severance.

Severance is great. I loved the atmosphere, which leaned on the claustrophobic side. I love minimalistic sets, so this was also big for me. The actors and their characters were great. I’ve seen Adam Scott only in comedies, so it was pretty cool to see him in a new light. He did wonderful.

The only thing I didn’t like, was the cliffhanger at the end of the season that cut off the story weirdly, and some mid-season slowness outside of work. I think we should get as much office time as we can get because it has an exciting base for really cool and hellish stories, there is a lot that can be explored creatively there.

Do watch it, though I suggest doing that right before season two, because of the season 1 cliffhanger.
