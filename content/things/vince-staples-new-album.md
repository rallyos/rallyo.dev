[As I start to bike more for lunch because of the nice weather](/things/biking-for-lunch), I also look up for albums to play with that. The new album from Vince Staples turns out is the perfect companion.

It has a bit of a sunny summer vibes, and biking out around the beach or on a sunny day as a whole while listening to it, is something that I strongly recommend. All of his albums are a good listen, and can count as summer-ish (including the release dates) but the latest one might be my favourite.
