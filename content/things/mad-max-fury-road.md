[![Scene from mad max fury road](https://img.youtube.com/vi/4OuGXlwO3Mo/hqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/4OuGXlwO3Mo)

Pressing play on Mad Max: Fury Road yesterday I definitely didn’t expect such movie. I wanted to watch it because I saw it in some [letterboxd](http://letterboxd.com) lists about world building and aesthetic.

On my movie nights I usually eat in the first 30 minutes, but this time I definitely didn’t expect to not be able to, for like 30 minutes. I usually play it, and do it on the boring or slow scenes. This time I started it and at the 15th minute I realised I haven’t even moved my attention from it.

Never have I watched a movie that keeps you that much invested. Usually the standard is “talk - action - rest - talk - action - rest”, but definitely not with Mad Max. You start it, you get 35 minutes of really beautiful and engaging action. Then you get a 3 minute breather to clear your mind, and then you are snatched again for another 30 minute crazy ride. That’s the formulae behind this picture until its end.

I don’t know how they were able to produce such film, but props to everyone involved. It’s a beauty to watch and follow the story.

If this was the standard for action movies, I would’ve been way more into them. Do see it.
