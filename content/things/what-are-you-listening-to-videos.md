As a big music fan, I’ve always wondered what people outside or in public transport are listening. Many times, judging them from outside, it’s not what you expected. That’s why the “what are you listening to” videos are this thing of the week for me.

It’s fascinating to see how overall music taste changes from [city](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8oYGC3Z1qE) to [city](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll72vq3mDXw&t=6s), and how most of the people [like sharing their musical taste](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8E7phXyckvU).
