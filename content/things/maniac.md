[![Maniac Trailer](https://img.youtube.com/vi/L6cDDmk-O5A/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/L6cDDmk-O5A)

Maniac was actually recommended to me, which is a very good thing because I would’ve probably missed it.

It’s part of my top 5 favourite shows in the last few years, but it’s hard to describe what is it about. Without spoiling much, what I love most about it is the different realities/simulations that the characters fall into.

I love science fiction, but even more, I love simulated realities, and this TV show has lots of them. I am still struggling to find movies or other TV shows that can even come close to how Maniac did them. Almost every episode had a weird dream like setup, and all of them were beautifully done. It will also be a mistake not to mention that the cast was perfectly selected, and every character was interesting to follow.

It’s definitely a TV show that will continue to come back to.
