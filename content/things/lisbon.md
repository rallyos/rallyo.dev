Recently, I got back from my first trip outside the country for a vacation since late 2019. I was in Lisbon with friends for a week and it was pretty cool.

The weather was 100% sunny, but a bit colder than I expected. I fell in love with a bar close to where we were staying at. We visited the oceanarium, which was a first for me. We ate in Taco Bell, also for a first time. We visited various castles and other tourist places.

My biggest impression was how hilly the city was. In some of my walks, I tracked an elevation gain of 200 meters. I’ve never been in a city with that big elevation differences from area to area. 

Though, that was stunning to see when our plane was approaching. It was like the city was built on levels. In some places, the downhill was pretty steep. To the point that I don’t feel it’s possible to travel with a bike.

Overall, I’d say it’s a pretty cool city. When I’m in someplace new, I always ask myself “Could you live here?”, and for Lisbon, the answer is probably no, but I am pretty sure I will visit it again soon. It definitely left a good impression on me.
