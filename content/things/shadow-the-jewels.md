[![Shadow The Jewels](https://img.youtube.com/vi/olvKBXMlodc/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/olvKBXMlodc)

For some years now, I’ve been listening to a mashup between two of my favourite musicians – DJ Shadow and Run The Jewels. The first time I found it was in a freezing winter, so I now have a tradition to listen to it nostalgically in the winter months every year. If you are a fan of both, or even one of the artists – you’ll enjoy it for sure.
