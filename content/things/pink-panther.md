[![The Pink Panther Show Episode 45](https://img.youtube.com/vi/FETaXhxCOeA/hqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/FETaXhxCOeA)

When I was little, I liked watching Pink Panther. I got a bit nostalgic this week when I saw it recommended to me on YouTube, and with the original episodes too.

It might be a good fit to play it at night, along with some lo-fi. It seems like a fitting background of nostalgia when I’m doing something that doesn’t require a lot of focus.

I miss some retro animated shows from the 90s, and I wish there were more of them available for streaming.
