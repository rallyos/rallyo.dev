[![Japanese Breakfast - Be Sweet ](https://img.youtube.com/vi/2ZfcZEIo6Bw/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZfcZEIo6Bw)


I have a soft spot for catchy basslines. That’s why I got addicted to Be Sweet by Japanese Breakfast the moment I heard it (thank you Pitchfork). It’s such a summerish song, I can’t wait to hear the whole album in June.
