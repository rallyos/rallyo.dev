A tradition to have when you finish a souls game, is to check the funny PVP videos, the speed run record, and the no hit run videos.

The last one is something new to me because I didn’t know such self-torture exists, but I guess the world is full of all kinds of wonderful people.

Dark Souls 2 is the most punishing from the series, so I’m seriously in awe that people try this. You get hit once, and you have to restart the game. The two videos I particularly like are from [Otzdarva](https://www.youtube.com/@Otzdarva).

[The first one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1igv3qUtHXg) sets the scene. It shows how horrible the experience is, but ends on a twist because Otzdarva got hit on the final boss of the last DLC.

[The second one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxTwZR-F8cg) thought is a masterpiece. It’s great storytelling and one of my favourite dark souls videos. This time we see all bosses being killed, without taking a single hit. And the video has all kinds of fun editing which makes it a pleasure to watch because let’s face it, few people want to just watch a plain boss fights from this game.

I don't understand why people choose to go through this, but it’s somewhat inspiring to see them not giving up after spending soo much time failing, and then starting again. It might teach you that failure is required for success.
