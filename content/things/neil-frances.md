[![Neil Frances - These Days](https://img.youtube.com/vi/S_MzNrkbJ34/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/S_MzNrkbJ34)

This year, I have a new favourite dream pop band (at least that’s how I categorise them). I don’t know where I heard them, probably a Spotify radio recommendation, but I kept a song from them in my skating playlist, until discovering more of them.

I’m a big fan of dream pop, but in the summer I’m especially big fan of summer nostalgically sounding bands like them. They are perfect companions while skating at the beach in the sunny hot weather or right before sunset.

I hope they continue to be that much active, they’ve been releasing singles and a new album, so that’s great. Strong recommendation from me. Oh, I should not forget to mention that I love their bass lines, that’s what probably sold me when I heard [Dumb Love](https://youtu.be/yPhmeeunqII).
