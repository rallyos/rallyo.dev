Historically, Fringe is one of my favourite TV shows. So, the minute I noticed that it was added to HBO Max – I checked out a few of my favourite episodes, which grew into quickly (with skips) rewatching the whole series in 2 weeks. 

It’s a show that started a little before the end of Lost, so it suffered a bit from the big shadow that Lost had at the time.

People say it’s heavily inspired from X-Files, and I can see that, but it’s also much more. Wonderfully created characters, top-notch acting, great world building and lore. It has a slow first season, but then it picks up, and excluding some filler episodes (it was the time when 24 episodes per season was the norm) it’s very intriguing to follow along. It should also be mentioned that it was, if not the first, one of the very first shows to be saved by a Twitter campaign from cancellation.

Do add it to your list.
