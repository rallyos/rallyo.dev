[![r/Place 2022 Timelapse](https://img.youtube.com/vi/K5O3UgLG2Jw/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/K5O3UgLG2Jw)

So, [r/place](http://reddit.com/r/place) is back again. It’s maybe the best, if not one of the best April Fools' Day events. The first one was 4 years ago, and the idea was that on this one reddit, you’ll be shown a massive canvas, where you can place 1 pixel of some colour, wherever you choose. And then be able to place another one in 5 minutes.

This year they are back with the same idea, and it was even cooler than the previous one. Of course, having the experience and knowledge from 4 years ago, there were more bots, way more interest, way more communication between the communities. There were also a couple of new twists, but the most important to me were the expanding of the canvas, and the end when you could only place white pixels. You could instantly see which artworks were made by using bots, as they became white instantly.

Definitely a great idea by Reddit, and I hope they follow up with another one next year because I don’t want to wait 4 more years for the next interesting April Fools' Day. I’m tired of the usual corporate jokes that are either a product release or a funny video.
