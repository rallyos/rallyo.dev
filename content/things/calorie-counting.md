I’ve never counted calories, well, I tried just once for a minute, but it sounded impossible to be able to track everything, so I just gave up straight away.

Now, I got back to working out actively, but was taken aback by the lack of noticeable progress. I started revising the foods I eat, learning that some things I eat almost every day should become more like a treat, than regular food. I also noticed that I need way more protein that I’ve been having in the previous years. That’s one of the reasons I want to promote calorie counting.

Another reason I think people should try it is that it makes it easy to plan meals. You know your calorie budget, you know how much you burn through sport, you have all the numbers that allow you to make early decisions on your diet, but more importantly – when to treat yourself, and how much.

It helps you get closer to your fitness goals, learn more about yourself, and how to make better dieting decisions. The only real negative is having to log foods multiple times a day. It takes a bit of mental energy to make it routine, but in some cases the pros outweigh the cons.

People use different apps. I very much like [Lose it](https://www.loseit.com) and use it daily to log food.
