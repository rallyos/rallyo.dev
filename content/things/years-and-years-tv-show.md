I don’t know how to explain Years and Years.
I’d say it’s lightweight Black Mirror as a base, but it’s also pretty different in some ways.

The idea of following a group of people for many “years and years” is new for me, and I liked it a lot. And while it does that, it makes a commentary on all the pressing issues at the time.

Overall, I liked it. It does get sad as you see people get older in the span of an episode, and the new challenges that they have to go through. Every time I heard the first few notes of the jump through the years I got a bit sad, saying “okay, here we go again”.

It’s a mix of sci-fi drama told through social commentary. It deserves a watch if you are into stories that are told creatively.
