[![How a Prop Malfunction Created One of the Most Iconic Cold Opens in “Office” History - Office Ladies ](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Da3SBwlgcDc/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Da3SBwlgcDc)

I am huge fan of The Office. Though I haven’t started to listen the Office Ladies podcast, I love the animated videos they’ve published on YouTube. Makes you wonder if an animated series of the show can work.
