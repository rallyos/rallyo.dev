[![How Bad Was The Great Oxidation Event?][image-1]][1]

There’s a whole corner in YouTube full of nicely done indie documentaries. One such finding is the [History of the Earth][2] channel.

I love this channel because its focus is **early earth and its extinctions** something that is very rare on YouTube, it is probably the only channel I know of that tells these stories in depth.

The story-writing is great, the narrating and editing fit the theme perfectly. It’s a must-watch if you are into knowing more about how our planet probably looked in the beginning.
