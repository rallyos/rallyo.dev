Iâ€™m a big enjoyer of skits on YouTube, and this week I highly recommend checking out [RDCworld1](https://www.youtube.com/@RDCworld1) channel.

They are very creative and some of my [favourite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVWioll0zX4) videos on YouTube come from them. Some, like [hood olympics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifqqp7kH_tQ&t=273s) or [haunted houses,](https://youtu.be/3NnHHiBvedo) have multiple editions. Others [stand on their own](https://youtu.be/wcvvT8rrVbI) but are still [related](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqWkwolb3as) to [one another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHN57ffa-9U).
