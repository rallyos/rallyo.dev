I won’t get into much details on this.

I don’t watch late night shows, but I binge watched most of the Conan remotes on YouTube in the span of 3 days. The majority them are very funny and the places they choose to film are very interesting. He is a gifted comedian, something that’s most notable when he’s improvising (as most of the remotes are done, I think).
