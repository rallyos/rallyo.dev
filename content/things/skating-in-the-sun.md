![Sunny sea alley][image-1]

Maybe the best thing about having an longboard, is the freedom it gives you while roaming around, and that is especially true when you are doing it on a sunny afternoon close to the sea.

Of course, sunny rides won’t be even half as much appealing, without having the right music to put yourself in an infinitely running background scene from Baywatch or any other cheesy American production taking place in LA. [And I have that as well][1].

This is one of my favourite spring/autumn activities, when for couple of months there aren’t that much people and the weather close to the sea is more forgiving.

Only if I had more time do it now...
