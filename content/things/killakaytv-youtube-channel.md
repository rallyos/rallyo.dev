Watching comedy on YouTube is one of my guilty pleasures. So, here comes another favourite of mine - [KillaKayTV](https://www.youtube.com/@killakay).

His sketches are one of the most original I’ve seen, because of his ability to portray every role in life – [Mother](https://youtu.be/k67csseVhyc), [Salesmen](https://youtu.be/6igozj0x1SA), [Barber](https://youtu.be/I42UW9MEgus), [Walmart worker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkyPWia9Qaw&t=3s), [Teacher](https://youtu.be/b7etJVhsFL8), the list goes on. In most of his videos, he also shows a great talent of [converting his house into a movie set](https://youtu.be/2_JqRnlxPMM).
