After more than 20 years of now owning a bike, I finally felt the need to buy myself one. I use it mainly for cycling with friends, but I can attest that it’s also a good workout replacement if I skip my rowing for some reason. The best part is that I use it to visit my grandmother, and this makes the road to there way more exciting. It is also a good alternative if I cannot get to a place with my longboard.

Another plus is that I’ll better prepare myself for when I hopefully move to The Netherlands.
