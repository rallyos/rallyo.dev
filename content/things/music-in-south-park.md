[![Heat of the moment South Park](https://img.youtube.com/vi/g__VoZbRvm0/hqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/g__VoZbRvm0)

Iâ€™m a big fan of South Park, as many other people are. But I always start smiling with excitement when I see that a song is about to be introduced to an episode.

They are always very creative and funny. Cartman singing some weird song should be a must every season. I can even go really far, and say that I would watch a South Park musical.

[I love them so much, I have a playlist which I try to update every time I see a song.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPLS_PpkN7SzSG6DYpRbXnru4-Yuu_kPN)
