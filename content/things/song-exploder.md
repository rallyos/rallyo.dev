I learned about [Song Exploder](https://songexploder.net) on [99% Invisible](http://99percentinvisible.org).

If you love music – this one is big. It’s a podcast where bands and artists talk about how they made a song of their choosing. They “explode” it in its building parts.

It has a few hundred episodes, so you are bound to find a song that you know. The implementation of the episodes is pretty good. Almost always the episode starts with the idea, the story of the song. Then the artist walks you through their process as it adds instrument after instrument, until you hear the final fleshed out result when all separate parts combined into the song.

I was pretty hyped up when I found that someone makes such content because it sounded to me like a niche with low interest. I was pleasantly surprised that this podcast has been on for years, and also had some pretty famous guests.

My favourite is [Mobb Deep – Shook Ones 2](https://songexploder.net/mobb-deep). My mind exploded hearing how parts of it were made. How Havoc slowed down a few piano chords, and turned them into one of the most recognisable hip-hop instrumentals.

 I strongly suggest that you explore its episodes and start from a favourite song you find. You’ll get hooked.
