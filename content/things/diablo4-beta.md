With nothing notable to share, and as I wait for the weather to fix itself, this week’s thing is the Diablo 4 beta.

I’m not a huge ARPG fan, but I play them here and there. This weekend I had a bit of a spare time to check out the Diablo 4 beta, and it was okay. I spent more time trying to improve my graphics, as I played it on a console, so I made it just to the first cutscene.

From the videos I saw though, it’s good that I didn’t invest much time, as it appears that the class balance was broken, which is somewhat expected from a beta.
