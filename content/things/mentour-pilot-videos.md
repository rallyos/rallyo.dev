From speaking with other people too, I can say that these weeks there is a channel on YouTube that is recommended to many people. Not only it looks very intriguing, but it’s around aviation – one of my passions.

The channel name is [Mentour Pilot](https://www.youtube.com/@MentourPilot). 

I was never a big fan of the aviation disasters series on National Geographic because I feel they are made for psychological effect, and I also don’t like reenactments with actors. Mentour Pilot’s videos are like a whole separate category.

They are created with a lot of effort of educating the audience. Every video starts with outlining the technical facts and details before the events start to unfold. And once the story comes to the reason for the video – the details are zoomed on a level of seconds. Moreover, let’s not forget the commentary from the creator, who is deep into the industry as well. Reenactments are done with flight simulators, so you are spared the weird psychological connection you can sometimes make when actors play out the events.

I don’t want to link favourites, just open the channel and choose one for yourself, you’ll be impressed.
