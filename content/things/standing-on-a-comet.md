Some day, I need to compile a list of my favourite videos that I sometime use to ease myself into sleep. This week I share one of my top 3. A [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/@Drekslerr) that imagines what will be the feeling if you are standing or in orbit of some of the most exotic objects in our solar system.

Very calm narrative, relaxing music, pictures from space â€“ they seem like they are created as adult nighttime stories, especially if you are into space exploration.

I recommend that you watch/listen to all of them, but my favourites are probably [standing on asteroids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQTBpq3f5s8&list=PLycDFnZLmfaDELZzsRyiUGupqMjQh-3iu&index=21), [standing on Saturn's rings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfbdrYev-v8&list=PLycDFnZLmfaDELZzsRyiUGupqMjQh-3iu&index=17), [standing on a comet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OVFwpDyPno&list=PLycDFnZLmfaDELZzsRyiUGupqMjQh-3iu&index=7), and [standing on Ceres](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgsLw9lYc00&list=PLycDFnZLmfaDELZzsRyiUGupqMjQh-3iu&index=6).
