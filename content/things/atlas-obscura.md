[Atlas Obscura](https://www.atlasobscura.com/) I discovered as a [podcast](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/podcast-nellie-mae-rowes-playhouse) first, of course, being featured on [99% invisible](http://99percentinvisible.org). Later I found out that the podcast is just part of their service – providing exploration of “the hidden wonders of the world”. But my thing of the week is the [podcast](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/podcast-nellie-mae-rowes-playhouse).

In it, they choose a place from their massive collection and tell its story. In some ways, it’s a travel podcast because they regularly share the story directly from the event or the location itself. I think the whole team prepares the podcast, so they produce many episodes per week, which makes them the most hard to follow podcast on my feed because I’m frequently behind with more than 5 episodes.

The quality is great, and their stories are very intriguing. Often, their episodes make me think how many places around us have a hidden or buried (literally) stories that are waiting for someone to do the research and interview the people that might know more. Which is something they do a couple of times per week. I recommend trying it, especially if you are into travel stories and history.
