![Inside of a train](/img/train.jpg)

After the summer passed and the flights to my city stopped, it was time to find another way of traveling to Sofia, and since I hate buses – train it is.

The lack of funding and corruption has made the railways here a last resort of travel. They do really have a bad reputation. But as I said – I hate buses, I've ridden far too many when I lived in Sofia, so I’ve exhausted that form of travel for many, many years. Not to mention that the highways are too dangerous for my comfort.

So, yeah – this week I caught a train to Sofia for a first time in 10 years. It was actually fine, excluding the surprisingly hot weather, which made the first half of the Sofia trip really horrible. But the rest was fine.

I did my research and booked a train where you are not forced to cramp with 5 other people. They are used only 1–2 times per day, so this limited my options for a time of travel, but a sacrifice I was willing to do.

All in all, I liked it, and will probably continue to use it throughout the winter. Definitely way more enjoyable than a bus.
