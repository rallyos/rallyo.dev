[![Dark Souls 3 Launch Trailer](https://img.youtube.com/vi/cWBwFhUv1-8/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/cWBwFhUv1-8)

After [finishing Dark Souls 2](/things/dark-souls-2), understandably I was on another indefinite break from gaming, but when I found out about the Elden Ring release date, I thought that doing Dark Souls 3 before it, will be nice preparation for it. And with these games, it’s best to stay in shape if you want to have smoother experience in them, and not die every 15 minutes.

People say that Dark Souls 3 is the best of the series, but I’m a bit reluctant to get behind that statement. It’s definitely good. It is also more related to the story of the first one, than DS2 is. But overall, I’d say it was just good. I don’t have a favourite Dark Souls, they are all great in their own way, though it does speak volumes that I get PTSD when I think about replaying DS2.

The bosses were really cool and way better than DS2, though I didn’t like that a good amount of them had a gimmick that made them easier, like a special weapon or a mechanic. I like better the grind type of bosses, where you just have to get good.

Continuing the tradition, the DLCs were better than the base game, and a bit harder. Though I did have some troubles in some zones in the earlier game. It felt nostalgic going back to Anor Londo, though it felt a bit bland.

The graphics were excellent, being the last game of the series, that was expected. My favourite bosses were [Sister Friede](https://youtu.be/Cn4k2fc5syE), which blew my mind because I wasn’t expecting a 3 phase boss. And [Slave Knight Gael](https://youtu.be/2y2NBCVdyJ4) felt like a dance, one of the most graphics heavy boss fights in the series, so much was happening in it.

Other bosses, like [Midir](https://youtu.be/jPlWnCE4Edo), were downright annoying. I spent hours on it. Long fights like Midir makes deaths so much punishing than normal.

Overall, a great game. Unapologetically Dark Souls to its core.
