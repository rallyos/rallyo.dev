I heard about this podcast on a Vox video I think, they had some kind of collaboration, and it sounded cool, so I just added it to Pocketcasts, for the far future when ideally I would’ve had the time. Podcasts can sit on my list for years without starting them, but when I decide to – I binge them as fast as I possibly can.

[99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org) as they say is “_about all the thought that goes into the things we don’t think about — the unnoticed architecture and design that shape our world._”.

I highly recommend it, although sometimes, especially in the first hundred episodes or so can be very US centric (as expected), you can learn interesting things about how the world around you works, and the invisible design decisions behind it.

It has countless episodes, since it’s been around for quite some time, but it’s worth it getting into it. A lot of team effort and research goes into it, and they always interview the right people, for more context into the topic. A recommended listen.
