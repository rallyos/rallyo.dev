![New Longboard](/img/new-longboard.jpg)

This week, I’m retiring my first longboard, that has been serving me diligently for more than a year and a half.

Not being a beginner anymore, I spent a bit more, on a beautiful Arbor longboard, from the collaboration series [with Aaron Draplin](https://www.arborcollective.com/pages/artist-aaron-james-draplin). It took me a few weeks to realise that that’s the person behind field notes, the great logo creation videos, and of course, many other things (I’m not deep into design, so forgive me).

It has been a bit hard to get used to it because it’s smaller than my previous one. I almost fell twice, just because I have a huge ego about it, and rode it as I did my previous one. I didn’t consider neither the different size nor what difference it makes when your gears are brand new and not stuffed with dirt.
