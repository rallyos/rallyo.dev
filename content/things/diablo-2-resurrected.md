I’m big on nostalgia, so the closer we got to the release, I couldn’t wait to relive my childhood of playing Diablo 2: LoD almost non-stop.

Of course, having a gamer ego now and not playing 100% for the fun of it, I decided to play on hardcore mode. Also, it was the first time I decided to play Amazon.

Having to be much more careful and slow was definitely painful and slow, but it was definitely more interesting, having played this game already for hundreds of hours in the past.

I ended up finishing only normal mode, and gave up around the beginning of nightmare which is kind of an easy hardcore mode, but I didn’t have the time or nerves to continue.
