[![The Merv Griffin show seinfeld](https://img.youtube.com/vi/VrE6B75c6QI/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/VrE6B75c6QI)

This year I’ve been [finishing Seinfeld](/things/seinfeld) and this week I want to share one of my top favourite episodes – the one with the Merv Griffin Show.

I don’t know who he was, but this episode is one of the best. The improvised late night show that Kramer does, with the set that he found in the garbage. Having the others as guests. The weirdness that the others show when they are on the set, with Kramer pretending to be a host.

Not to mention the moment when George enters the set, with the most confused look, while having introduction music. It’s one of the top 5 moments of his character.

Aside from the improvised show, the side stories of this episode are good too. I strongly recommend it (and the show, of course). It’s historic.
