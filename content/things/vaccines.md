It’s here, the most awaited scientific product recently - the COVID vaccine. I got my first shot recently and I’m kind of hyped about the opportunities that it will open for me. I’ll finally feel safe to travel to Sofia to see my friends there.

I’ve been expecting and reading about the vaccines since October 2020 so it’s kind of unbelievable that we are finally here. Hopefully the breakthroughs in this pandemic will help us defend ourselves better in the future.

Hopefully they can help us end the pandemic easier or faster. Either way - it’s cool to finally have a main weapon that we can depend on in the fight.
