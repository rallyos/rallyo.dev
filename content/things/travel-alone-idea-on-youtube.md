I got a nice recommendation a while ago, I think it was because of my few searches on Japan. It was a channel showing some cool ways of traveling [alone through the country](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-pFS-qLNJQ).

Since then, I’ve been hooked on them. They are like visual ASMR. They are really calm, and always only captioned, so you are 100% focused on the things you see, instead of the storyteller.

It is showing interesting places one can book [for sleeping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_VDTKrWcuw&t=301s) there. [First class bus seats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd-0gNeiiWk) with wonderful sights. And all the [supplementary cool things](https://youtu.be/UOqaoDSTB8A) to the experience, that are weird and foreign to someone that haven’t stepped in Asia. Yet.
