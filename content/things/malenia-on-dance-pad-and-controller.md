[![2x Malenia defeated at once](https://img.youtube.com/vi/kjdK44BXHD4/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/kjdK44BXHD4)

I’ve seen no hit runs and other challenges that people like to torture themselves with, but for the first time I saw someone playing the game not only in two parallel versions, but also with different controllers. One of them being a dance pad. Now I’ve seen it all.

I think I was stuck on Malenia for a good 6–10 hours overall, so seeing it being beaten simultaneously on a controller and dance pad is massively impressive.

I have massive respect for people like [MissMikkaa](http://twitch.tv/missmikkaa) that go through this, so we don’t have to. Not to mention doing it live in front of thousands of people. You can just watch and admire.
