I was never a movie buff. I rarely missed a good sci-fi, but I’ve always been more of a TV shows guy.
Through the years though I missed seeing some movies, and my watch list started to grow unconformably big, so I was already feeling the pressure of not having seen some pictures.

This will be changing as of this year. I’ve been hearing of [letterboxd](http://letterboxd.com). And I think it will be the service that will push me back, and even more than before, into films. It’s nothing new that gamification and tracking progress can push people into doing stuff that they otherwise find hard to, I guess it’s the sense of reward or achievement that you get from it.

Anyway, I love how [letterboxd](http://letterboxd.com) is done. It focuses on community. It has lists. The profiles are so cool looking. The design is minimalistic and welcoming. Every time I visit it, it impresses me how they designed it. I love looking at [my profile](http://letterboxd.com/rallyo/). I wish it had a series version because [TV Time](http://tvtime.com) is somewhat frozen in terms of development or resolving issues. 

People also use it to leave reviews. I like how some of them try to be funny and sarcastic, even I do it occasionally. This also changed a bit how I watch films too. Oftentimes I catch myself trying to rate the movie before it ended, or writing down funny thoughts that I can use for my review. The other big positive is that you can discover a lot through the lists feature. There are pretty cool community lists, but I am yet to dive in there.

I am planning to watch over 100 films this year, turning my weekend nights into movie nights, so hopefully the added value of having them rated and reviewed in letterboxd will help me do that.
