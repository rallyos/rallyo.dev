I’ve been wanting to have colourful lights for quite some time. As a lo-fi enjoyer, [having your home in neon blue light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5U9dkOgkA-w&t=33703s) is a must.

When the time to invest in this came, I watched many reviews on YouTube that were all saying that I don’t need to pay for Philips Hue. They were all saying that the Hue lights are expensive just because, and there were lights that provide the same experience way cheaper.

I decided to try Govee and the light was just horrible. It felt like I was living in a photo studio from the 80s and I have to be careful not to expose the film to light, and defoliate it. The blue was too hard on my eyes. The purple was painful. I just thought that this is how it is, and everybody just silently goes with it.

I don’t remember why I decided to try the Hue, it might be the HomeKit integration, but I’m so happy I did. First, the colours are great, and they feel easy to the eyes. The HomeKit integration is welcome. And the hub was not that big of a deal as everybody says it is.

Since then, I’ve bought the Hue Play bars, the Hue Go desk lamp. And I have plans for to add way more lights to the collection.

They also have a great app. Automations are flexible and have many preset and cool options. It allows you to sync music and your screen with the lights, though I don’t use that feature much. I had a good fun with it watching The Expanse, though.

I can strongly recommend them for everyone on the market for smart lights.
