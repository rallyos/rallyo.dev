[![Biggie Smalls - Juicy (Lofi Remix)][image-1]][1]

There’s rarely any video that encompasses that amount of things I like — games, hip-hop, lo-fi, and a hint of nostalgia. It’s like a Venn diagram tailored to me. I found this mix a year ago, but just now I get to share it, along with [the playlist][2].

These remixes are so chill and cool, I listen to them every weekend.
