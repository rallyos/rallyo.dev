I’ve kept this for some years, and because this week has been a bit slow, maybe it’s time to share it as a thing of the week. It’s probably my favourite space related speech. It was given by NASA’s Anne McClain when the first SpaceX Crew Dragon docket to the International Space Station.

Hear it for yourself. It’s a beautiful speech, about spaceflight, about why we should continue working together, and how much we achieve by doing so.
