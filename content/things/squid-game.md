I’m always a bit behind on the widely popular TV shows, so I’m probably late to the party, but this week I binged Squid Game.

I think in this case (which I can’t say for most of the very popular shows) it’s worth the watch. Most of the ideas were cool and interesting to follow.

The big takeaway for me were the family dynamics in South Korea. It’s the first South Korean work I’ve seen, and the country specific side of the stories were as intriguing as the game rounds.

Knowing the story of how hard it was for the team to find money and place for this show, it makes me think how many other potentially good TV shows we miss because of that. I recommend it.
