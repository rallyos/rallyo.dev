[![Riding e-scooter](https://img.youtube.com/vi/X8ULTr8t5tw/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/X8ULTr8t5tw)

I had a bit of a busy week, so instead of something meaningful, I’ll just embed my video of riding a Lime scooter in Frankfurt. It was my first time because I kind of hate them, but they make sense in big cities when you don’t have a bike, but you want to flexibly move between two points.
