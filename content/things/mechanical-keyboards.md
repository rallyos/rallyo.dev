![Mechanical Keyboard](/img/keyboard.jpg)

External keyboards are something I never really cared about. I used laptop keyboards for as long as I can remember.

Once I bought myself a 4k external display, I had the excuse to start researching into finally buying one. See, I work on my late 2015 MacBook and if you use it in closed (clamshell) mode, you can get a bit of a performance boost. That promise was the main driver behind the change, but also the freedom to choose how your keyboard can sound.

After checking numerous videos from the experts on YouTube, I decided to buy a Keychron K2 with brown switches.

So far, I love the change and I think I’m never going back. It sounds great, it feels great, and it gives you the feeling of freedom. If I don’t like something – I can most probably change it, or buy another keyboard that allows me. It’s freedom that you don’t get with laptop keyboards, and not only that – all of them have the silent shallow switches that just don’t feel right to me.

I still have to re-train my muscle memory, which is somewhat annoying, but it’s worth it.

I used exclusively laptop keyboards for 10 years. It’s time for a change.
