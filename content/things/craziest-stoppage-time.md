[![The craziest stoppage time](https://img.youtube.com/vi/A1BcrAByBqw/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/A1BcrAByBqw)

One of the news outlets that I follow shared this video of a championship game between Ipswich and Charlton, that was going 2:2 in the regular time, but then it got to 4:4 in the stoppage time of 6 (8) minutes. It’s a regular league game, so not the most important game of the season, but nevertheless – what a way to end a game. And mad props to Charlton for still having hope after receiving two goals in the stoppage time. It’s hard to get back and equalise the game after being down like that.

The whole thing is a good proof of how crazy football can be, though these crazy endings are a bit more regular in England.
