[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is my note-taking app that I plan to use as a personal wiki, and also a bit more like a [second brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com). I’m a [big Bear fan](/things/bear), and I still plan to keep using it, but as a place where I can scribble notes quickly. Then over the weekend I can get back to them to decide whether I should categorise and leave them there, or I should structure them better and move them to Obsidian.

I’m in big need of a place to keep coding snippets and related knowledge because it’s very hard to remember obscure terminal commands that you use once in a few months. But there’s clear productivity gain from having them in an easily accessible place.

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) I initially got to know because of their backlines, graph view and other reference features that turn your notes into a network of connected information. But with time I guess they developed a big community, so one of their biggest selling points right now, at least to me, are the plugins. There are a ton of great plugins and themes (it’s highly customisable) which makes it easy to make it your own. Although, I’m not a big fan of customisable productivity tools because it can make it hard to migrate into another tool if the need arises. I’ve always been a fan of pure markdown note-taking apps because you are not locked in their weird specialised syntax. You can always grab your markdown and move on to a better tool.

So far, I use just a couple quality of life plugins – a random note button that makes it easy to remember, review, and go back to some of your notes. A calendar, and a plugin that helps you write at a given interval of time (daily, weekly and so on), which is useful if you do weekly reviews, or a journal for example.
I’m still building my connected notes, and it’s a bit hard to decide how to organise it, but maybe I’ll get more used to it with time. They also offer paid features which help them grow. Do try it on, you’ll like it.
