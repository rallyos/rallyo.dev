I’ve been a VIM user for close to 6 years. I always used the regular one, though with a good number of plugins. Haven’t made a change in my setup for about in 3 years, so I guess I was ready to shake things up.

I started watching [The Primeagen’s streams](https://www.twitch.tv/theprimeagen) (he is a strong [neovim](http://neovim.io) advocate) and noticed that he had a pretty cool [neovim](http://neovim.io) setup. So, after some careful deliberation on my side, the moment I saw a plugin that would’ve been a lifesaver for me when I worked exclusively on a laptop display – I was hooked.

I followed one of his [setup tutorials](https://youtu.be/w7i4amO_zaE) and I got everything working in a few hours. What I missed, I added in the following days. I still have some things to configure, but I can freely work on [neovim](http://neovim.io) now. Here, I have to say that [neovim](http://neovim.io) requires way much more manual work than a regular vim setup.

So far, I love the plugins, and I love that it’s written in an understandable language. It’s way more comfortable trying to debug Lua, than vim script. Not to mention, because of the language choice and the strong community – the development is always on the edge – meaning that you get new shiny integrations quicker than on the regular vim. Like [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot/). My Lua is still bad, but I’m excited about my future workflow.
