[![So tried elden ring](https://img.youtube.com/vi/LSyRf8rAjTs/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/LSyRf8rAjTs)

The thing of this week is another great YouTube channel. It’s [Carbot Animations](https://www.youtube.com/@CarbotAnimations).

They produce very creative and funny animated videos of various games. Their style is pretty unique. I love very much the [Elden Ring series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSyRf8rAjTs&list=PL0QrZvg7QIgpCbON63OPDLhEtNKBXvWPn). The[ Diablo II series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSzSKYxfLpA&list=PL0QrZvg7QIgptOuNWY9u45bnDtKWYs1Qr&index=13). And of course – the [World of Warcraft series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0QrZvg7QIgrjTWQU8qooMxK9GX4DyZg8).  
  
If you’ve played these games even for a little, you’ll definitely enjoy the animations. Most often they satirise the funny situations you may fall into as a player. Especially Elden Ring, in which you are supposed to suffer as a new player.

It’s one of the most talented animation channel out there, absolutely check their videos out.
