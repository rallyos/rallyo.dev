This week I found about a [Spotify feature that I didn’t know existed](https://community.spotify.com/t5/FAQs/What-is-Automix/ta-p/5257278).

I was listening to a Spotify made [electronic playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWX9ZIH7jslKG?si=b4d3d2d4cb5847e6) and started to notice that songs just don’t end. ”Is this a one song” I wandered as the tempo changed, but barely. And to my surprise – it was a different song. There was some kind of crossfade in this playlist, that made the transition smoother – a dream feature of mine.

I was pretty surprised. With Spotify being one of my favourite services, I try to follow development, but it seemed that this time I’ve missed something. I started to test it out, and yeah – songs crossfaded seamlessly into other songs based on how they sound, woah.

Later that day, still very surprised, I searched a bit more about it, and found out that it’s called Automix. It has been available for some years, but only on [some Spotify made electronic playlists](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Desktop-Windows/Where-can-i-find-a-list-of-playlists-that-support-the-Auto-DJ/td-p/4566723), which totally explains why I didn’t find about it earlier.

I do really hope they extend it to personal playlists because if I can do this for my playlists – they will be even greater than they are now.
