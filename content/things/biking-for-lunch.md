The spring is slowly giving up to the summer, and my favourite thing right now is going out to bike to some place and grab lunch from it. I still eat it at home while watching some TV show, but going out in the nice weather, around people, and including a mild workout in it, is a pretty good way to relieve the monotony of working from home.

Sporadically, I even plan my lunch in a way that allows me to bike around the beach. I recommend such activity at least a few times a week to everyone who works from home. It can be for any other reason, but spending part of your lunch break outside I think is pretty helpful to having a great mood, Iâ€™ve found.
