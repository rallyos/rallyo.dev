I’ve been behind on my queue of TV shows, but I’m shooting things from my list from time to time. This week I watched Russian Doll after it was recommended to me. It’s a nice, funny drama. A modern, very creative twist on a Groundhog Day like story, if you wish.

It has a good acting and a creative story that’s unpredictable. I mostly loved how the birthday party wanes with every episode.
