This week’s thing is another YouTube channel. [The Normies](https://www.youtube.com/@TheNormies) create reaction and review videos of various TV shows and movies. They are very interesting to watch, and often when I watch something, I check if they’ve made a watch reaction to it.

There’s something funny about watching people react to a twist or exciting scene that you know is coming. Also, you may learn things about the show because frequently someone is a big fan of the show they watch, and provides extra context to the story.

To be honest, I don’t know how they do it. I like to watch my shows in a very limited setting, and watching a show I like with a group of people and the lights turned on is definitely not for me. I guess that good content requires giving up some freedom. On the other side, the social element is nice, though.

As my all-time favourite show, I loved the most [The Expanse series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46ZtR6ieDMc&list=PLbZ4CA8my7fS6ul1a7dwhcschMUdjNSp4). But I regularly go back to watch others, like [Black Mirror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbRmIp2p0hM&list=PLbZ4CA8my7fSk2xbhWXl0PyyUKnEUMK6K), [The Good Place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNJCC6PTLLk&list=PLbZ4CA8my7fQKgF0yAGu3kAvHVItmXcBy), [South Park](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0qfPepum5o&list=PLbZ4CA8my7fQL4Hz7whZRPEcqZP96g5fJ), and [some movies](https://youtu.be/vVncJ_Qs7Ng). I Strongly recommend it if you are into react content and TV shows.
