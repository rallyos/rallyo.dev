[![MF Doom lofi remix](https://img.youtube.com/vi/z9_prlDi8L0/hqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/z9_prlDi8L0)

[I’m a big fan of the hip-hop lo-fi remixes](/things/lo-fi-biggie), but this week I got a surprise recommendation from YouTube – a lo-fi remix of MF Doom’s work.

Maybe it’s related to a search I did because right now, I’m in a bit of MF Doom phase, but either way the remix is pretty great. I recommend it strongly, especially for a night listen. More remixes from the creator [can be found here](https://www.dbegun.com/music).

Hip-hop was built on recycling great music, so I’m all hands up for such projects.
