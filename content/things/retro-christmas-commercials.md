It’s the holidays. I usually have several Christmas lo-fi videos that I listen to for the mood, but this year I had a new idea – find retro Christmas commercials – and play them as a background to the music. The result was a highly “vapour” nostalgic feel. Not to mention their VHS like quality.

I love nostalgic retro television and these vintage commercials were a great night companion in the last few weeks. There are a couple of different ones, and all of them have interesting or funny commercials, great to have on the side while doing something else.
