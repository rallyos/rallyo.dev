[![Voyage 5 (Chillwave - Synthwave - Retrowave Mix)][image-1]][1]

I have listened to some synthwave videos on YouTube, but I have newfound love for them because [they mix perfectly in my early morning routine][2]. Every morning that I start wondering what I should listen to - I end up with a nice melancholic synthwave video with a [cool futuristic anime scene][3]. 

Sometimes I listen to a [night themed one][4], but I prefer the [sunny ones][5] (My favourite, but sadly it’s blocked for now, hopefully this changes in the future)

They’ve helped me find in discovering some synthwave bands/artists as well, so I can start creating my own playlists which is always nice.
